  Problem Statement
  Let f(A, B) be the exclusive OR of A, A+1, ..., B. Find f(A, B).

  What is exclusive OR?
  The bitwise exclusive OR of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (let us call it y) is defined as follows:

  When y is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k â‰¥0) is 1 if, the number of integers among c_1, c_2, ...c_m whose binary representations have 1 in the 2^k's place, is odd, and 0 if that count is even.

  For example, the exclusive OR of 3 and 5 is 6. (When written in base two: the exclusive OR of 011 and 101 is 110.)

  // This leaves us with the XOR of the remaining numbers.

  if (A % 2 == 0 && B % 2 == 0) {
