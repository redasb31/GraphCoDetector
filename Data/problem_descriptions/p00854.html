<p>
Letâ€™s play a stone removing game.
</p>

<p>
Initially, <i>n</i> stones are arranged on a circle and numbered 1, ... , <i>n</i> clockwise (Figure 1). You are also given two numbers <i>k</i> and <i>m</i>. From this state, remove stones one by one following the rules explained below, until only one remains. In step 1, remove stone <i>m</i>. In step 2, locate the <i>k</i>-th next stone clockwise from <i>m</i> and remove it. In subsequent steps, start from the slot of the stone removed in the last step, make <i>k</i> hops clockwise on the remaining stones and remove the one you reach. In other words, skip (<i>k</i> - 1) remaining stones clockwise and remove the next one. Repeat this until only one stone is left and answer its number.
</p>
<p>
For example, the answer for the case <i>n</i> = 8, <i>k</i> = 5, <i>m</i> = 3 is 1, as shown in Figure 1.

<p>
<b>Initial state</b>: Eight stones are arranged on a circle.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 1</b>: Stone 3 is removed since <i>m</i> = 3.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 2</b>: You start from the slot that was occupied by stone 3. You skip four stones 4, 5, 6 and 7 (since <i>k</i> = 5), and remove the next one, which is 8.
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 3</b>: You skip stones 1, 2, 4 and 5, and thus remove 6. Note that you only count stones that are still on the circle and ignore those already removed. Stone 3 is ignored in this case.
</p>

<p>
<b>Steps 4-7</b>: You continue until only one stone is left. Notice that in later steps when only a few stones remain, the same stone may be skipped multiple times. For example, stones 1 and 4 are skipped twice in step 7.
</p>

<p>
<b>Final State</b>: Finally, only one stone, 1, is on the circle. This is the final state, so the answer is 1.

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple datasets each of which is formatted as follows.
</p>

<pre>
<i>n k m</i>
</pre>

<p>
The last dataset is followed by a line containing three zeros. Numbers in a line are separated by a single space. A dataset satisfies the following conditions.
</p>
<center>
<p>
                         2 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 10000,    1 &le; <i>k</i> &le; 10000,    1 &le; <i>m</i> &le; <i>n</i>
</p>
</center>

<p>
The number of datasets is less than 100.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each dataset, output a line containing the stone number left in the final state. No extra characters such as spaces should appear in the output.
