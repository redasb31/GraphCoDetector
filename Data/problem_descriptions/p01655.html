<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
You bought 3 ancient scrolls from a magician. These scrolls have a long string, and the lengths of the strings are the same. He said that these scrolls are copies of the key string to enter a dungeon with a secret treasure.
However, he also said, they were copied so many times by hand, so the string will contain some errors, though the length seems correct. 
</p>

<p>
Your job is to recover the original string from these strings. When finding the original string, you decided to use the following assumption. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>  The copied string will contain at most <var>d</var> errors. In other words, the Hamming distance of the original string and the copied string is at most <var>d</var>. </li>
<li>  If there exist many candidates, the lexicographically minimum string is the original string.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Can you find the orignal string?
</p>


<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
The input contains a series of datasets.
</p>

<p>
Each dataset has the following format:
</p>

<pre>
<var>l</var> <var>d</var>
<var>str_1</var>
<var>str_2</var>
<var>str_3</var>
</pre>

<p>
The first line contains two integers <var>l</var> (<var>1 \leq l \leq 100,000</var>) and <var>d</var> (<var>0 \leq d \leq 5,000</var>.)
<var>l</var> describes the length of 3 given strings and <var>d</var> describes acceptable maximal Hamming distance.
The following 3 lines have given strings, whose lengths are <var>l</var>.
These 3 strings consist of only lower and upper case alphabets.
</p>

<p>
The input ends with a line containing two zeros, which should not be processed. 
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
Print the lexicographically minimum satisfying the condition in a line.
If there do not exist such strings, print <code>-1</code>.
</p>
