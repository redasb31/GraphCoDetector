<p>
Mary Thomas has a number of sheets of squared paper. Some of squares are painted either in black or some <i>colorful</i> color (such as red and blue) on the front side. Cutting off the unpainted part, she will have eight opened-up unit cubes. A unit cube here refers to a cube of which each face consists of one square.
</p>

<p>
She is going to build those eight unit cubes with the front side exposed and then a bicube with them. A bicube is a cube of the size 2 &times; 2 &times; 2, consisting of eight unit cubes, that satisfies the following conditions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> faces of the unit cubes that comes to the inside of the bicube are all black;</li>
<li> each face of the bicube has a uniform <i>colorful</i> color; and</li>
<li> the faces of the bicube have colors all different.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your task is to write a program that reads the specification of a sheet of squared paper and decides whether a
bicube can be built with the eight unit cubes resulting from it.
</p>



<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input contains the specification of a sheet. The first line contains two integers <i>H</i> and <i>W</i>, which denote the height and width of the sheet (3 &le; <i>H</i>, <i>W</i> &le; 50). Then H lines follow, each consisting of <i>W</i> characters. These lines show the squares on the front side of the sheet. A character represents the color of a grid: alphabets and digits ('A' to 'Z', 'a' to 'z', '0' to '9') for colorful squares, a hash ('#') for a black square, and a dot ('.') for an unpainted square. Each alphabet or digit denotes a unique color: squares have the same color if and only if they are represented by the same character.
</p>

<p>
Each component of connected squares forms one opened-up cube. Squares are regarded as connected when they have a common edge; those just with a common vertex are not.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
Print "<span>Yes</span>" if a bicube can be built with the given sheet; "<span>No</span>" otherwise.
