<h2>B - Cube Coloring</h2>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
Great painter Cubic is famous for using cubes for his art. Now, he is engaged in a new work of art. He tries to form an $X \times Y \times Z$ rectangular parallelepiped by arranging and piling up many $1 \times 1 \times 1$ cubes such that the adjacent surfaces of cubes are fully shared.
</p>

<p>
Of course, he won't finish his work only arranging and piling up cubes. The position of each cube is denoted by $(0,0,0)$ through $(X-1,Y-1,Z-1)$ as by the ordinary coordinate system, and Cubic calls the cube $(A,B,C)$ the <i>origin cube</i>. Then, he paints a pattern on the rectangular parallelepiped with different colors according to the distance between each cube and the origin cube. He paints all cubes regardless of whether or not a cube is visible externally. This is his artistic policy. He uses <i>Manhattan distance</i> as the distance between cubes. The Manhattan distance between two cubes $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ is defined as $|x_1-x_2| + |y_1-y_2| + |z_1-z_2|$.
</p>

<p>
On the current work, Cubic decides to use $N$ colors, which are numbered from $1$ to $N$. He paints a cube with the $(i+1)$-th color if the distance $D$ between the cube and the origin cube satisfies $D \equiv i \pmod{N}$. 
</p>

<p>
Cubic wants to estimate the consumption of each color in order to prepare for the current work. He asks a great programmer, you, to write a program calculating the number of cubes that will be painted by each color.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
The input contains seven integers $X$, $Y$, $Z$, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $N$. All integers are in one line and separated by a single space. Three integers $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ ($1 \leq X, Y, Z \leq 10^6$) represent the length of each side of the rectangular parallelepiped that Cubic tries to form. Three integers $A$, $B$, and $C$ ($0 \leq A \lt X$, $0 \leq B \lt Y$, $0 \leq C \lt Z$) represent the position of the origin cube. The number of kinds of colors is denoted by $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 1{,}000$).
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
The output contains $N$ integers in one line. The $i$-th integer ($1 \leq i \leq N$) represents the number of the cubes that will be painted by the $i$-th color. All integers must be separated by a single space.
