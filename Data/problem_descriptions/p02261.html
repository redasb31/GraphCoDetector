<p>
Let's arrange a deck of cards. There are totally 36 cards of 4 suits(S, H, C, D) and 9 values (1, 2, ... 9). For example, 'eight of heart' is represented by <span>H8</span> and 'one of diamonds' is represented by <span>D1</span>.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to write a program which sorts a given set of cards in ascending order by their values using the Bubble Sort algorithms and the Selection Sort algorithm respectively. These algorithms should be based on the following pseudocode:
</p>

<pre>
BubbleSort(C)
1 for i = 0 to C.length-1
2     for j = C.length-1 downto i+1
3         if C[j].value < C[j-1].value
4             swap C[j] and C[j-1]
</pre>

<pre>
SelectionSort(C)
1 for i = 0 to C.length-1
2     mini = i
3     for j = i to C.length-1
4         if C[j].value < C[mini].value
5             mini = j
6     swap C[i] and C[mini]
</pre>

<p>
Note that, indices for array elements are based on 0-origin.
</p

<p>
For each algorithm, report the stability of the output for the given input (instance). Here, 'stability of the output' means that: cards with the same value appear in the output in the same order as they do in the input (instance).
</p>

<!--
<p>
Note that, cards with same values but different suits must be appear in the same order of the input sequence.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The first line contains an integer <i>N</i>, the number of cards.
</p>

<p>
<i>N</i> cards are given in the following line. Each card is represented by two characters. Two consecutive cards are separated by a space character.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
In the first line, print the arranged cards provided by the Bubble Sort algorithm. Two consecutive cards should be separated by a space character.
</p>

<p>
In the second line, print the stability ("<span>Stable</span>" or "<span>Not stable</span>") of this output.
</p>

<p>
In the third line, print the arranged cards provided by the Selection Sort algorithm. Two consecutive cards should be separated by a space character.
</p>

<p>
In the fourth line, print the stability ("<span>Stable</span>" or "<span>Not stable</span>") of this output.
</p>
