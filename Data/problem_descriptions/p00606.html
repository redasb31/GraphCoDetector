<p>
Dr. Asimov, a robotics researcher, loves to research, but hates houseworks and his house were really dirty. So, he has developed a cleaning robot.
</p>

<p>
As shown in the following figure, his house has 9 rooms, where each room is identified by an alphabet:
</p>

<br>

<p>
The robot he developed operates as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the battery runs down, the robot stops.
</li>
<li> If not so, the robot chooses a direction from four cardinal points with the equal probability, and moves to the room in that direction. Then, the robot clean the room and consumes 1 point of the battery. 
</li>

<li>
However, if there is no room in that direction, the robot does not move and remains the same room. In addition, there is a junk room in the house where the robot can not enter, and the robot also remains when it tries to enter the junk room. The robot also consumes 1 point of the battery when it remains the same place.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A battery charger for the robot is in a room. It would be convenient for Dr. Asimov if the robot stops at the battery room when its battery run down.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to write a program which computes the probability of the robot stopping at the battery room.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of several datasets. Each dataset consists of:
</p>

<pre>
<i>n</i>
<i>s t b</i>
</pre>

<p>
<i>n</i> is an integer that indicates the initial battery point. <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>b</i> are alphabets respectively represent the room where the robot is initially, the battery room, and the junk room.
</p>

<p>
The input ends with a dataset which consists of single 0 for <i>n</i>. Your program should not output for this dataset.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each dataset, print the probability as a floating point number in a line. The answer may not have an error greater than 0.000001.
</p>

<H2>Constraints</H2>
<ul>
<li>Judge data includes at most 100 data sets.</li>
<li><i>n</i> &le; 15</li>
<li><i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>b</i> are distinct.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Sample Input</H2>
<pre>
1
E A C

E B C
2
E A B

<H2>Output for the Sample Input</H2>
<pre>
0.00000000
0.25000000
0.06250000
