<H1>Board Arrangements for Concentration Games</H1>

<P>You have to organize a wedding party. The program of the
party will include a concentration game played by the
bride and groom. The arrangement of the concentration game
should be easy since this game will be played to make the
party fun.</P>

<P>We have a 4x4 board and 8 pairs of cards (denoted by `A' to `H')
for the concentration game:</P>
<PRE>
   +---+---+---+---+ 
   |   |   |   |   |   A A B B
   +---+---+---+---+   C C D D
   |   |   |   |   |   E E F F
   +---+---+---+---+   G G H H
   |   |   |   |   |
   +---+---+---+---+ 
   |   |   |   |   |
   +---+---+---+---+ 
</PRE>

<P>To start the game, it is necessary to arrange all 16 cards
face down on the board. For example:</P>
<PRE>
   +---+---+---+---+ 
   | A | B | A | B |
   +---+---+---+---+
   | C | D | C | D |
   +---+---+---+---+
   | E | F | G | H |
   +---+---+---+---+ 
   | G | H | E | F |
   +---+---+---+---+ 
</PRE>

<P>The purpose of the concentration game is to expose as many
cards as possible by repeatedly performing the following
procedure: (1) expose two cards, (2) keep them open if they
match or replace them face down if they do not.</P>

<P>Since the arrangements should be simple, every pair of cards
on the board must obey the following condition: the
relative position of one card to the other card of the pair must be
one of 4 given relative positions.
The 4 relative positions are different from one another and
they are selected from the following 24 candidates:</P><PRE>
                                      (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0),
   (-3, 1), (-2, 1), (-1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1),
   (-3, 2), (-2, 2), (-1, 2), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2),
   (-3, 3), (-2, 3), (-1, 3), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3).
</PRE>

<P>Your job in this problem is to write a program that
reports the total number of board arrangements which satisfy
the given constraint.  For example, if relative positions
(-2, 1), (-1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2) are given, the total number
of board arrangements is two, where the following two
arrangements satisfy the given constraint:</P><PRE>
     X0  X1  X2  X3             X0  X1  X2  X3
    +---+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+ 
 Y0 | A | B | C | D |       Y0 | A | B | C | D | 
    +---+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+ 
 Y1 | B | A | D | C |       Y1 | B | D | E | C | 
    +---+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+ 
 Y2 | E | F | G | H |       Y2 | F | A | G | H | 
    +---+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+ 
 Y3 | F | E | H | G |       Y3 | G | F | H | E | 
    +---+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+ 
 the relative positions:    the relative positions:
    A:(1, 1),  B:(-1, 1)       A:(1, 2),  B:(-1, 1)
    C:(1, 1),  D:(-1, 1)       C:(1, 1),  D:(-2, 1)
    E:(1, 1),  F:(-1, 1)       E:(1, 2),  F:( 1, 1)
    G:(1, 1),  H:(-1, 1)       G:(-2, 1), H:(-1, 1)
</PRE>

<P>Arrangements of the same pattern should be counted only once.  Two
board arrangements are said to have the same pattern if they are
obtained from each other by repeatedly making any two pairs exchange
their positions.  For example, the following two arrangements have the
same pattern:
</P><PRE>

     X0  X1  X2  X3           X0  X1  X2  X3
    +---+---+---+---+        +---+---+---+---+ 
 Y0 | H | G | F | E |     Y0 | A | B | C | D | 
    +---+---+---+---+        +---+---+---+---+ 
 Y1 | G | E | D | F |     Y1 | B | D | E | C | 
    +---+---+---+---+        +---+---+---+---+ 
 Y2 | C | H | B | A |     Y2 | F | A | G | H | 
    +---+---+---+---+        +---+---+---+---+ 
 Y3 | B | C | A | D |     Y3 | G | F | H | E | 
    +---+---+---+---+        +---+---+---+---+ 
</PRE>
where (1) `A' and `H',
(2) `B' and `G',
(3) `C' and `F', and
(4) `D' and `E'
exchange their positions respectively.

<H2>Input</H2>

<P>The input contains multiple data sets, each representing 4 relative 
positions. A data set is given as a line in the following format.</P>

<DIR><TABLE><TR>
<TD>x<SUB>1</SUB></TD><TD>y<SUB>1</SUB></TD>
<TD>x<SUB>2</SUB></TD><TD>y<SUB>2</SUB></TD>
<TD>x<SUB>3</SUB></TD><TD>y<SUB>3</SUB></TD>
<TD>x<SUB>4</SUB></TD><TD>y<SUB>4</SUB></TD>
</TR></TABLE></DIR>

<P>The i-th relative position is given by (x<SUB>i</SUB>, y<SUB>i</SUB>).
You may assume that the given relative positions are different from one 
another and each of them is one of the 24 candidates.</P>

<P>The end of input is indicated by the line which contains
a single number greater than 4.</P>

<H2>Output</H2>

<P>For each data set, your program should output the total number
of board arrangements (or more precisely, the total number of 
patterns).</P>

<P>Each number should be printed in one line. Since your result is 
checked by an automatic grading program,
you should not insert any extra characters nor lines on the output.
