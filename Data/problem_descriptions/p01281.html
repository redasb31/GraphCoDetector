<p>
A tatami mat, a Japanese traditional floor cover, has a rectangular form with aspect ratio 1:2. When
spreading tatami mats on a floor, it is prohibited to make a cross with the border of the tatami mats,
because it is believed to bring bad luck.
</p>
<p>
Your task is to write a program that reports how many possible ways to spread tatami mats of the same
size on a floor of given height and width.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset cosists of a line which contains two integers <i>H</i> and <i>W</i> in this order, separated with a single
space. <i>H</i> and <i>W</i> are the height and the width of the floor respectively. The length of the shorter edge of a
tatami mat is regarded as a unit length.
</p>
<p>
You may assume 0 &lt; <i>H</i>, <i>W</i> &le; 20.
</p>

<p>
The last dataset is followed by a line containing two zeros. This line is not a part of any dataset and should not be processed.
</p>


<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each dataset, print the number of possible ways to spread tatami mats in one line.
