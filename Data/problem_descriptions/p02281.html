<H1>Tree Walk</H1>




<p>
Binary trees are defined recursively. A binary tree <i>T</i> is a structure defined on a finite set of nodes that either
</p>

<ul>
<li>contains no nodes, or</li>
<li>is composed of three disjoint sets of nodes:<br>

- a root node.<br>
- a binary tree called its left subtree.<br>
- a binary tree called its right subtree.<br>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your task is to write a program which perform tree walks (systematically traverse all nodes in a tree) based on the following algorithms:
</p>


<ol>
<li>Print the root, the left subtree and right subtree (preorder).</li>
<li>Print the left subtree, the root and right subtree (inorder).</li>
<li>Print the left subtree, right subtree and the root (postorder).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here, the given binary tree consists of <i>n</i> nodes and evey node has a unique ID from 0 to <i>n</i>-1.
</p>


<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The first line of the input includes an integer <i>n</i>, the number of nodes of the tree.
</p>
<p>
In the next <i>n</i> linen, the information of each node is given in the following format:
</p>

<p>
<i>id left right</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>id</i> is the node ID, <i>left</i> is ID of the left child and <i>right</i> is ID of the right child. If the node does not have the left (right) child, the <i>left</i>(<i>right</i>) is indicated by <span>-1</span>
</p>


<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
In the 1st line, print "<span>Preorder</span>", and in the 2nd line print a list of node IDs obtained by the preorder tree walk.
</p>

<p>
In the 3rd line, print "<span>Inorder</span>", and in the 4th line print a list of node IDs obtained by the inorder tree walk.
</p>

<p>
In the 5th line, print "<span>Postorder</span>", and in the 6th line print a list of node IDs obtained by the postorder tree walk.
</p>

<p>
Print a space character before each node ID.
</p>
