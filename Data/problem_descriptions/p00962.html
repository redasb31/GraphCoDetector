<h2>Problem F
  Pizza Delivery
  </h2>

<p>
  Alyssa is a college student, living in New Tsukuba City. All the streets in the city are one-way. A new social experiment starting tomorrow is on alternative traffic regulation reversing the one-way directions of street sections. Reversals will be on one single street section between two adjacent intersections for each day; the directions of all the other sections will not change, and the reversal will be canceled on the next day.
</p>

<p>
Alyssa orders a piece of pizza everyday from the same pizzeria. The pizza is delivered along the shortest route from the intersection with the pizzeria to the intersection with Alyssa's house.
</p>

<p>
  Altering the traffic regulation may change the shortest route. Please tell Alyssa how the social experiment will affect the pizza delivery route.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
  The input consists of a single test case in the following format.
</p>

<pre>
$n$ $m$
$a_1$ $b_1$ $c_1$
...
$a_m$ $b_m$ $c_m$
</pre>

<p>
  The first line contains two integers, $n$, the number of intersections, and $m$, the number of street sections in New Tsukuba City ($2 \leq n \leq 100 000, 1 \leq m \leq 100 000$). The intersections are numbered $1$ through $n$ and the street sections are numbered $1$ through $m$.
</p>

<p>
  The following $m$ lines contain the information about the street sections, each with three integers $a_i$, $b_i$, and $c_i$ ($1 \leq a_i  n, 1 \leq b_i \leq n, a_i \ne b_i, 1 \leq c_i \leq 100 000$). They mean that the street section numbered $i$ connects two intersections with the one-way direction from $a_i$ to $b_i$, which will be reversed on the $i$-th day. The street section has the length of $c_i$. Note that there may be more than one street section connecting the same pair of intersections.
</p>

<p>
  The pizzeria is on the intersection 1 and Alyssa's house is on the intersection 2. It is guaranteed that at least one route exists from the pizzeria to Alyssa's before the social experiment starts.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  The output should contain $m$ lines. The $i$-th line should be
</p>
<ul>
<li> <span>HAPPY</span> if the shortest route on the $i$-th day will become shorter,</li>
<li> <span>SOSO</span> if the length of the shortest route on the $i$-th day will not change, and</li>
<li> <span>SAD</span> if the shortest route on the $i$-th day will be longer or if there will be no route from the pizzeria to Alyssa's house.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Alyssa doesn't mind whether the delivery bike can go back to the pizzeria or not.
