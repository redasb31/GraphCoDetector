<H1>Maximum Heap</h1>

<p>
  A binary heap which satisfies max-heap property is called max-heap. In a max-heap, for every node $i$ other than the root, $A[i] \leq A[parent(i)]$, that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent. The largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains values no larger than that contained at the node itself.
</p>
<p>
  Here is an example of a max-heap.

<p>
  Write a program which reads an array and constructs a max-heap from the array based on the following pseudo code.
</p>

<p>
 $maxHeapify(A, i)$ move the value of $A[i]$ down to leaves to make a sub-tree of node $i$ a max-heap. Here, $H$ is the size of the heap.
</p>

<pre>
1  maxHeapify(A, i)
2      l = left(i)
3      r = right(i)
4      // select the node which has the maximum value
5      if l &le; H and A[l] &gt; A[i]
6          largest = l
7      else 
8          largest = i
9      if r &le; H and A[r] &gt; A[largest]
10         largest = r
11
12     if largest &ne; iã€€// value of children is larger than that of i
13         swap A[i] and A[largest]
14         maxHeapify(A, largest) // call recursively
</pre>

<p>
  The following procedure buildMaxHeap(A) makes $A$ a max-heap by performing maxHeapify in a bottom-up manner.
</p>

<pre>
1 buildMaxHeap(A)
2    for i = H/2 downto 1
3        maxHeapify(A, i)
</pre>


<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
  In the first line, an integer $H$ is given. In the second line, $H$ integers which represent elements in the binary heap are given in order of node id (from $1$ to $H$).
</p>


<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
  Print values of nodes in the max-heap in order of their id (from $1$ to $H$). <u>Print a single space character before each value.</u>
</p>

<H2>Constraint</H2>

<ul>
<li>$1 \leq H \leq 500,000$</li>
<li>$-2,000,000,000 \leq$ value of a node $\leq 2,000,000,000$</li>
</ul>
