<p>
There is a grid of size <i>W</i> &times; <i>H</i> surrounded by walls. Some cells in the grid are occupied by slimes. The slimes want to unite with each other and become a "King Slime".
</p>

<p>
In each move, a slime can move to east, west, south and north direction until it enters a cell occupied by another slime or hit the surrounding wall. If two slimes come together, they unite and become a new slime.
</p>

<p>
Your task is write a program which calculates the minimum number of moves that all the slimes unite and become a King Slime. Suppose slimes move one by one and they never move simultaneously.
</p>



<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The first line contains three integers <i>N</i> (2 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 40,000), <i>W</i> and <i>H</i> (1 &le; <i>W</i>, <i>H</i> &le; 100,000), which denote the
number of slimes, the width and the height of the grid respectively.
</p>

<p>
The following <i>N</i> lines describe the initial coordinates of the slimes. The <i>i</i>-th line contains two integers <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> (1 &le; <i>x<sub>i</sub></I> &le; <i>W</i>) and <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> (1 &le; <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> &le; <i>H</i>), which indicate the coordinates of the <i>i</i>-th slime . All the coordinates are 1-based.
</p>

<p>
You may assume that each cell is occupied by at most one slime initially.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
Output the minimum number of moves that all the slimes unite and become a King Slime.
