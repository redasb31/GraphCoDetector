<p>
Champernowne constant is an irrational number. Its decimal representation starts with "0.", followed by concatenation of all positive integers in the increasing order.
</p>

<p>
You will be given a sequence <i>S</i> which consists of decimal digits. Your task is to write a program which computes the position of the first occurrence of S in Champernowne constant after the decimal point.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input has multiple test cases. Each line of the input has one digit sequence. The input is terminated by a line consisting only of <span>#</span>.
</p>

<p>
It is guaranteed that each sequence has at least one digit and its length is less than or equal to 100.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each sequence, output one decimal integer described above. You can assume each output value is less than 10<sup>16</sup>.
