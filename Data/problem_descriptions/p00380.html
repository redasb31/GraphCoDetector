<h1>Bozosort</h1>
    ã€€
<p>
  Bozosort, as well as Bogosort, is a very inefficient sort algorithm. It is a random number-based algorithm that sorts sequence elements following the steps as below:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Randomly select two elements and swap them.</li>
<li> Verify if all the elements are sorted in increasing order.</li>
<li> Finish if sorted, else return to 1.</li>

</ol>

<p>
  To analyze Bozosort, you have decided to simulate the process using several predetermined pairs of elements.
</p>

<p>
  You are given several commands to swap two elements. Make a program to evaluate how many times you have to run the command before the sequence is aligned in increasing order.
</p>


<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
The input is given in the following format.
</p>
<pre>
$N$
$a_1$ $a_2$ ... $a_N$
$Q$
$x_1$ $y_1$
$x_2$ $y_2$
$...$
$x_Q$ $y_Q$
</pre>

<p>
The first line provides the number of sequence elements $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 300,000$). The second line provides an array of integers $a_i$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) that constitutes the sequence. Each of the subsequent $Q$ lines provides a pair of integers $x_i,y_i$ ($1 \leq x_i,y_i \leq N$) that represent the $i$-th command, which swaps the two elements indicated by $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($x_i \ne y_i$).
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
  If neat alignment in increasing order is realized the first time after execution of multiple commands, output at what time it was. Output <span>0</span> if the initial sequence is aligned in increasing order, and <span>-1</span> if exhaustive execution still failed to attain the goal.
