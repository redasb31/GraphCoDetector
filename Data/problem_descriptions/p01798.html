<h2>Problem I
Midpoint</h2>


<p>
One day, you found $L + M + N$ points on a 2D plane, which you named $A_1, ..., A_L, B_1, ...,B_M, C_1,...,C_N$. Note that two or more points of them can be at the same coordinate. These were named after the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
<li> the points $A_1,...,A_L$ were located on a single straight line,</li>
<li> the points $B_1,...,B_M$ were located on a single straight line, and</li>
<li> the points $C_1,...,C_N$ were located on a single straight line.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, you are interested in a triplet $(i, j, k)$ such that $C_k$ is the midpoint between $A_i$ and $B_j$. Your task is counting such triplets.
</p>


<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
The first line contains three space-separated positive integers $L$, $M$, and $N$ $(1 \leq L, M, N \leq 10^5)$. The next $L$ lines describe $A$. The $i$-th of them contains two space-separated integers representing the $x$-coordinate and the $y$-coordinate of $A_i$. The next $M$ lines describe $B$. The $j$-th of them contains two space-separated integers representing the $x$-coordinate and the $y$-coordinate of $B_j$. The next $N$ lines describe $C$. The $k$-th of them contains two space-separated integers representing the $x$-coordinate and the $y$-coordinate of $C_k$. It is guaranteed that the absolute values of all the coordinates do not exceed $10^5$.
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
Print the number of the triplets which fulfill the constraint.
