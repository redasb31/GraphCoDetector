<p>
The committee members of the Kitoshima programming contest had decided to use crypto-graphic software for their secret communication. They had asked a company, Kodai Software,
to develop cryptographic software that employed a cipher based on highly sophisticated mathematics.
</p>

<p>
According to reports on IT projects, many projects are not delivered on time, on budget, with
required features and functions. This applied to this case. Kodai Software failed to implement
the cipher by the appointed date of delivery, and asked to use a simpler version that employed
a type of substitution cipher for the moment. The committee members got angry and strongly
requested to deliver the full specification product, but they unwillingly decided to use this inferior
product for the moment.
</p>

<p>
In what follows, we call the text before encryption, plaintext, and the text after encryption,<i>
ciphertext</i>.
</p>

<p>
This simple cipher substitutes letters in the plaintext, and its substitution rule is specified with
a set of pairs. A pair consists of two letters and is unordered, that is, the order of the letters
in the pair does not matter. A pair (A, B) and a pair (B, A) have the same meaning. In one
substitution rule, one letter can appear in at most one single pair. When a letter in a pair
appears in the plaintext, the letter is replaced with the other letter in the pair. Letters not
specified in any pairs are left as they are.
</p>

<p>
For example, by substituting the plaintext
</p>
<pre>
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
</pre>

<p>
with the substitution rule {(A, Z), (B, Y)} results in the following ciphertext.
</p>
<pre>
ZYCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXBA
</pre>
	
<p>
This may be a big chance for us, because the substitution rule seems weak against cracking.
We may be able to know communications between committee members. The mission here is to
develop a deciphering program that finds the plaintext messages from given ciphertext messages.
</p>

<p>
A ciphertext message is composed of one or more ciphertext words. A ciphertext word is
generated from a plaintext word with a substitution rule. You have a list of candidate words 
containing the words that can appear in the plaintext; no other words may appear. Some words
in the list may not actually be used in the plaintext.
</p>

<p>
There always exists at least one sequence of candidate words from which the given ciphertext
is obtained by some substitution rule. There may be cases where it is impossible to uniquely
identify the plaintext from a given ciphertext and the list of candidate words.
</p>


<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple datasets, each of which contains a ciphertext message and a list
of candidate words in the following format.
</p>

<p>
<i>n</i><br>
<i>word</i><sub>1</sub><br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
<i>word</i><sub>n</sub><br>
<i>sequence</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>n</i> in the first line is a positive integer, representing the number of candidate words. Each of the
next <i>n</i> lines represents one of the candidate words. The last line, sequence, is a sequence of one
or more ciphertext words separated by a single space and terminated with a period.
</p>

<p>
You may assume the number of characters in each <i>sequence</i> is more than 1 and less than or
equal to 80 including spaces and the period. The number of candidate words in the list, <i>n</i>, does
not exceed 20. Only 26 uppercase letters, A to Z, are used in the words and the length of each
word is from 1 to 20, inclusive.
</p>

<p>
A line of a single zero indicates the end of the input.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>
<p>
For each dataset, your program should print the deciphered message in a line. Two adjacent
words in an output line should be separated by a single space and the last word should be
followed by a single period. When it is impossible to uniquely identify the plaintext, the output
line should be a single hyphen followed by a single period.
