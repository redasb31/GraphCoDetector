<h2>Problem F:
Marching Course
</h2>

<p>
Since members of Kitafuji High School Brass Band Club succeeded in convincing their stern
coach of their playing skills, they will be able to participate in Moon Light Festival as a marching
band. This festival is a prelude in terms of appealing their presence for the coming domestic
contest. Hence, they want to attract a festival audience by their performance.
</p>

<p>
Although this festival restricts performance time up to $P$ minutes, each team can freely determine
their performance course from a provided area. The provided area consists of $N$ checkpoints,
numbered 1 through $N$, and $M$ bidirectional roads connecting two checkpoints. Kitafuji Brass
Band already has the information about each road: its length and the expected number of people
on its roadside. Each team must start at the checkpoint 1, and return back to the checkpoint
1 in $P$ minutes. In order to show the performance ability of Kitafuji Brass Band to a festival
audience, their stern coach would like to determine their performance course so that many people
listen their march as long as possible.
</p>

<p>
The coach uses "impression degree" to determine their best course. If they play $m$ minutes on
the road with length $d$ and the expected number $v$ of people, then the impression degree will be
$m \times v/d$. The impression degree of a course is the sum of impression degree of their performance
on the course. Marching bands must move at a constant speed during marching: 1 unit length
per 1 minute. On the other hand, they can turn in the opposite direction at any time, any place
including a point on a road. The impression degree is accumulated even if they pass the same
interval two or more times.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to write a program to determine a course with the maximum impression degree in
order to show the performance ability of Kitafuji Brass Band to an audience as much as possible.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input is formatted as follows.<br>
<br>
$N$ $M$ $P$<br>
$s_1$ $t_1$ $d_1$ $v_1$<br>
: : :<br>
$s_M$ $t_M$ $d_M$ $v_M$<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
The first line contains three integers $N$, $M$, and $P$: the number of checkpoints $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq
200$), the number of roads $M$ ($N - 1 \leq M \leq N(N - 1)/2$), and the performance time $P$
($1 \leq P \leq 1,000$). The following $M$ lines represent the information about roads. The $i$-th line
of them contains four integers $s_i$, $t_i$, $d_i$, and $v_i$: the $i$-th road bidirectionally connects between
checkpoints $s_i$ and $t_i$ ($1 \leq s_i, t_i \leq N, s_i \ne t_i$) with length $d_i$ ($1 \leq d_i \leq 1,000$) and the expected
number $v_i$ ($1 \leq v_i \leq 1,000$) of people.
</p>

<p>
You can assume that any two checkpoints are directly or indirectly connected with one or more
roads. You can also assume that there are no pair of roads having the same pair of endpoints.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output the maximum impression degree of a course for a $P$-minute performance. The absolute
error should be less than $10^{-4}$.
