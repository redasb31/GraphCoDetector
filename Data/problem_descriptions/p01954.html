Sum Source Detection
</H1>

<p>
  JAG members began a game with integers. The game consists of $N + M + 1$ players: $N$ open number holders, $M$ secret number holders, and one answerer, you.
</p>

<p>
  In the preparation, an integer $K$ is told to all $N + M + 1$ players. $N + M$ number holders choose their own integers per person under the following restrictions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Each holder owns a positive integer.</li>
<li>The sum of all the integers equals $K$.</li>
<li>Every integer owned by secret number holders is strictly less than any integers owned by open number holders.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  After the choices, $N$ open number holders show their integers $O_1, ..., O_N$ to the answerer while secret number holders do not.
</p>

<p>
The game has $Q$ rounds. At the beginning of each round, $M$ secret number holders can change their numbers under
the above restrictions, while open number holders cannot. Then $N + M$ number holders select part of members among
them arbitrary, calculate the sum $X$ of the integers owned by the selected members, and tell $X$ to the answerer. For
each round, the answerer tries to identify the definitely selected open number holders from the information $K$, $X$, and $O_1, ..., O_N$: The answerer will get points per actually selected open number holder in the answer. On the other hand, if the answer contains at least one non-selected member, you lose your points got in the round. Thus, the answerer, you, must answer only the open number holders such that the holders are definitely selected.
</p>

<p>
Your task in this problem is to write a program to determine all the open number holders whose integers are necessary to the sum for each round in order to maximize your points.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of a single test case formatted as follows.
</p>

<pre>
$N$ $M$ $K$ $Q$
$O_1$ ... $O_N$
$X_1$ ... $X_Q$
</pre>

<p>
  The first line consists of four integers $N, M, K,$ and $Q$. $N$ and $M$ are the numbers of open number holders and secret number holders respectively ($1 \leq N, 0 \leq M, N + M \leq 40$). $K$ is an integer ($1 \leq K \leq 200,000$). $Q$ is the number of rounds of the game ($1 \leq Q \leq 10,000$).
</p>

<p>
  The second line contains $N$ integers $O_1, ..., O_N$, as the $i$-th open number holder owns $O_i$ ($1 \leq O_1 \leq ... \leq O_N \leq K$).
</p>

<p>
  The third line indicates $Q$ integers $X_1, ..., X_Q$ ($0 \leq X_i \leq K$). $X_i$ is the sum of the integers owned by the selected members in the $i$-th round.
</p>

<p>
  It is guaranteed that there is at least one way to compose $X_i$. In other words, you can assume that there is at least one integer sequence $S_1, ..., S_M$, which represents integers owned by secret number holders, satisfying the followings:
</p>

<ul>
<li>$0 < S_j < O_1$ for $1 \leq j \leq M$. Note that $O_1 = min_{1\leq k \leq N}O_k$ holds.</li>
<li>$\sum_{j=1}^N O_j + \sum_{k=1}^M S_k = K$.</li>
<li>There is at least one pair of subsets $U \subseteq \{1,...,N\}$ and $V \subseteq \{1, ..., M\}$ such that $\sum_{j\in U} O_j + \sum_{k\in V}S_k = X_i$ holds.</li>
  </ul>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
On each sum $X_i$, print the indices of the open number holders whose integers are required to make up $X_i$. The output for each sum has to be printed in one line, in ascending order, and separated by a single space. If there is no open number holder whose integer is certainly used for $X_i$, print $-1$ in one line.
</p>

<H2>Sample Input 1</H2>
<pre>
2 2 23 2
7 10
9 10
</pre>

<H2>Output for Sample Input 1</H2>
<pre>
1
-1
</pre>

<p>
The first sum 9 can be achieved only by the first open number holder's 7 plus 2 of a secret number holder. In this case, secret number holders have 2 and 4. The second open number holder's 10 is a candidate for the second sum 10. The first open holder's 7 plus 3 is also possible one, as secret number holders have two 3s.
</p>



<H2>Sample Input 2</H2>
<pre>
1 1 100 3
51
49 51 100
</pre>

<H2>Output for Sample Input 2</H2>
<pre>
-1
1
1
</pre>

<p>
The only secret number holder owns 49. The output for the first sum is $-1$ because the open number holder's 51 is not selected.
</p>


<H2>Sample Input 3</H2>
<pre>
2 1 58152 4
575 57500
575 57577 77 0
</pre>

<H2>Output for Sample Input 3</H2>
<pre>
1
2
-1
-1
</pre>

<p>
In this case, the only secret number holder definitely has 77. The output for the last sum 0 is -1 because no integer of open number holders is needed to form 0.
  </p>

<H2>Sample Input 4</H2>
<pre>
3 2 1500 1
99 300 1000
99
</pre>

<H2>Output for Sample Input 4</H2>
<pre>
1
</pre>

<p>
The only way to compose 99 is to select the first open number holder only; secret number holders have two integers
between 1 and 98, while the sum of them must be 101.
</p>

<H2>Sample Input 5</H2>
<pre>
3 2 20 19
3 3 11
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
</pre>

<H2>Output for Sample Input 5</H2>
<pre>
-1
-1
-1

1 2 3

1 2 3
</pre>

<p>
The numbers owned by the two secret number holders are 1 and 2. At least one open number holder's 3 is required to
compose 5 and 6 respectively, but it is impossible to determine the definitely selected open number holder(s). On the other hand, 7 needs the two open number holders who both own 3.
