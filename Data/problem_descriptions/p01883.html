<h2>Parentheses</h2>

<p>
Dave loves strings consisting only of '(' and ')'. Especially, he is interested in balanced strings. Any balanced strings can be constructed using the following rules:
</p>

<ul>
<li> A string "()" is balanced.</li>
<li> Concatenation of two balanced strings are balanced.</li>
<li> If $T$ is a balanced string, concatenation of '(', $T$, and ')' in this order is balanced. For example, "()()" and "(()())" are balanced strings. ")(" and ")()(()" are not balanced strings.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Dave has a string consisting only of '(' and ')'. It satises the followings:
</p>

<ul>
<li> You can make it balanced by swapping adjacent characters exactly $A$ times. </li>
<li> For any non-negative integer $B$ ($B < A$), you cannot make it balanced by $B$ swaps of adjacent characters.</li>
<li> It is the shortest of all strings satisfying the above conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your task is to compute Dave's string. If there are multiple candidates, output the minimum in lexicographic order. As is the case with ASCII, '(' is less than ')'.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input consists of a single test case, which contains an integer $A$ ($1 \leq A \leq 10^9$).
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output Dave's string in one line. If there are multiple candidates, output the minimum in lexicographic order.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input 1</h3>
<pre>
1
</pre>

<h3>Output for the Sample Input 1</h3>
<pre>
)(
</pre>
<p>
There are infinitely many strings which can be balanced by only one swap. Dave's string is the shortest of them.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input 2</h3>
<pre>
4
</pre>

<h3>Output for the Sample Input 2</h3>
<pre>
)())((
</pre>
<p>
String "))(()(" can be balanced by 4 swaps, but the output should be ")())((" because it is the minimum in lexicographic order.
</p>
