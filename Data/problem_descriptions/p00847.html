<p>
Let's play a puzzle using eight cubes placed on a 3 &times; 3 board leaving one empty square.
</p>
<p>
Faces of cubes are painted with three colors. As a puzzle step, you can roll one of the cubes to
the adjacent empty square. Your goal is to make the specified color pattern visible from above
by a number of such steps.
</p>
<p>
The rules of this puzzle are as follows.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Coloring of Cubes:</b> All the cubes are colored in the same way as shown in Figure 3.
The opposite faces have the same color.

<li>
<b>Initial Board State:</b> Eight cubes are placed on the 3 &times; 3 board leaving one empty square.
All the cubes have the same orientation as shown in Figure 4. As shown in the figure,
squares on the board are given <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates, (1, 1), (1, 2), .. ., and (3, 3). The
position of the initially empty square may vary.

</li>


<li>
<b>Rolling Cubes:</b> At each step, we can choose one of the cubes adjacent to the empty square and roll it into the empty square, leaving the original position empty. Figure 5
shows an example.

<li>
<b>Goal:</b> The goal of this puzzle is to arrange the cubes so that their top faces form the
specified color pattern by a number of cube rolling steps described above.

</li>

</ol>


<p>
Your task is to write a program that finds the minimum number of steps required to make the
specified color pattern from the given initial state.

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input is a sequence of datasets. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two
zeros separated by a space. The number of datasets is less than 16. Each dataset is formatted
as follows.
</p>
<pre>
        <i>x y</i>
        <i>F</i><sub>11</sub> <i>F</i><sub>21</sub> <i>F</i><sub>31</sub>
        <i>F</i><sub>12</sub> <i>F</i><sub>22</sub> <i>F</i><sub>32</sub>
        <i>F</i><sub>13</sub> <i>F</i><sub>23</sub> <i>F</i><sub>33</sub>
</pre>

<p>    
The first line contains two integers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> separated by a space, indicating the position (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)
of the initially empty square. The values of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are 1, 2, or 3.
</p>
<p>
The following three lines specify the color pattern to make. Each line contains three characters
<i>F</i><sub>1<i>j</i></sub>, <i>F</i><sub>2<i>j</i></sub>, and <i>F</i><sub>3<i>j</i></sub>, separated by a space. Character <i>F<sub>ij</sub></i> indicates the top color of the cube, if any, at position (<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) as follows:
</p>
<pre>
       B: Blue
       W: White
       R: Red
       E: the square is Empty.
</pre>

<p>
There is exactly one '<span>E</span>' character in each dataset.

</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each dataset, output the minimum number of steps to achieve the goal, when the goal can
be reached within 30 steps. Otherwise, output "<span>-1</span>" for the dataset.
