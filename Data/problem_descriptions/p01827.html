<h2>Problem J:
Black Company
</h2>

<p>
JAG Company is a sweatshop (sweatshop is called "burakku kigyo" in Japanese), and you are
the CEO for the company.
</p>

<p>
You are planning to determine $N$ employees' salary as low as possible (employees are numbered
from 1 to $N$). Each employee's salary amount must be a positive integer greater than zero. At
that time, you should pay attention to the employees' contribution degree. If the employee $i$'s
contribution degree $c_i$ is greater than the employee $j$'s contribution degree $c_j$ , the employee i
must get higher salary than the employee $j$'s salary. If the condition is not satisfied, employees
may complain about their salary amount.
</p>

<p>
However, it is not necessarily satisfied in all pairs of the employees, because each employee can
only know his/her close employees' contribution degree and salary amount. Therefore, as long as
the following two conditions are satisfied, employees do not complain to you about their salary
amount.
</p>

<ul>
<li> If the employees $i$ and $j$ are close to each other, $c_i < c_j \Leftrightarrow  p_i < p_j$ must be satisfied, where
$p_i$ is the employee $i$'s salary amount.</li>
<li> If the employee $i$ is close to the employees $j$ and $k$, $c_j < c_k \Leftrightarrow  p_j < p_k$ must be satisfied.
Write a program that computes the minimum sum of all employees' salary amount such that no
employee complains about their salary.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
Each input is formatted as follows:<br>
<br>
$N$<br>
$c_1$ ... $c_N$<br>
$M$<br>
$a_1$ $b_1$<br>
...<br>
$a_M$ $b_M$<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100,000$), which indicates the number of employees.
The second line contains $N$ integers $c_i$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq 100,000$) representing the contribution degree
of employee $i$.
</p>

<p>
The third line contains an integer $M$ ($0 \leq M \leq 200,000$), which specifies the number of relationships. Each of the following $M$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($a_i \ne b_i, 1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq N$).
It represents that the employees $a_i$ and $b_i$ are close to each other. There is no more than one
relationship between each pair of the employees.
</p>

Print the minimum sum of all employees' salary amounts in a line.
