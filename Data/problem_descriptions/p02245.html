<H1>8 Puzzle</H1>


<p>
  The goal of the 8 puzzle problem is to complete pieces on $3 \times 3$ cells where one of the cells is empty space. 
</p>

<p>
  In this problem, the space is represented by 0 and pieces are represented by integers from 1 to 8 as shown below.
</p>

<pre>
1 3 0
4 2 5
7 8 6
</pre>

<p>
  You can move a piece toward the empty space at one step. Your goal is to make the pieces the following configuration in the shortest move (fewest steps).
</p>


<pre>
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0
</pre>

<p>
  Write a program which reads an initial state of the puzzle and prints the fewest steps to solve the puzzle.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
