<H1>Bubble Sort</H1>

<p>
Write a program of the Bubble Sort algorithm which sorts a sequence <i>A</i> in ascending order. The algorithm should be based on the following pseudocode:
</p>

<pre>
BubbleSort(A)
1 for i = 0 to A.length-1
2     for j = A.length-1 downto i+1
3         if A[j] < A[j-1]
4             swap A[j] and A[j-1]
</pre>
<p>
Note that, indices for array elements are based on 0-origin.
</p>

<p>
Your program should also print the number of swap operations defined in line 4 of the pseudocode.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The first line of the input includes an integer <i>N</i>, the number of elements in the sequence.
</p>
<p>
In the second line, <i>N</i> elements of the sequence are given separated by spaces characters.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
The output consists of 2 lines. 
</p>

<p>
In the first line, please print the sorted sequence. Two contiguous elements of the sequence should be separated by a space character.
</p>

<p>
In the second line, please print the number of swap operations.
</p>

<H2>Constraints</H2>

<p>
1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100
