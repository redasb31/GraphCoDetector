<h2>Entrance Examination</h2>

<p>
The International Competitive Programming College (ICPC) is famous
for its research on competitive programming.
Applicants to the college are required to take its entrance examination.
</p>

<p>
The successful applicants of the examination are chosen as follows.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The score of any successful applicant is higher than that of any unsuccessful applicant.</li>
<li>The number of successful applicants <i>n</i> must be between <i>n</i><sub>min</sub> and <i>n</i><sub>max</sub>, inclusive.
We choose <i>n</i> within the specified range that maximizes the <i>gap.</i>
Here, the <i>gap</i> means the difference between the lowest score of
successful applicants and the highest score of unsuccessful applicants.
</li>
<li> When two or more candidates for <i>n</i> make exactly the same <i>gap,</i>
use the greatest <i>n</i> among them.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Let's see the first couple of examples given in Sample Input below.
In the first example, <i>n</i><sub>min</sub> and <i>n</i><sub>max</sub> are two and four, respectively, and there are five applicants whose scores are 100, 90, 82, 70, and 65.
For <i>n</i> of two, three and four, the gaps will be 8, 12, and 5, respectively.
We must choose three as <i>n</i>, because it maximizes the gap.
</p>

<p>
In the second example, <i>n</i><sub>min</sub> and <i>n</i><sub>max</sub> are two and four, respectively, and there are five applicants whose scores are 100, 90, 80, 75, and 65.
For <i>n</i> of two, three and four, the gap will be 10, 5, and 10, 
respectively. Both two and four maximize the gap, and we must choose the
 greatest number, four.
</p>

<p>
You are requested to write a program that computes the number of successful applicants that satisfies the conditions.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is formatted as follows.
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>m</i> <i>n</i><sub>min</sub> <i>n</i><sub>max</sub><br>
<i>P</i><sub>1</sub><br>
<i>P</i><sub>2</sub><br>
...<br>
<i>P<sub>m</sub></i><br>
</blockquote>

<p>
The first line of a dataset contains three integers separated by single spaces.
<i>m</i> represents the number of applicants, <i>n</i><sub>min</sub> represents the minimum number of successful applicants, and <i>n</i><sub>max</sub> represents the maximum number of successful applicants.
Each of the following <i>m</i> lines contains an integer
<i>P<sub>i</sub></i>, which represents the score of each applicant.
The scores are listed in descending order.
These numbers satisfy 0 &lt; <i>n</i><sub>min</sub> &lt; <i>n</i><sub>max</sub> &lt; <i>m</i> &#8804; 200, 0 &#8804; <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> &#8804; 10000 (1 &#8804; <i>i</i> &#8804; <i>m</i>) and  <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i><sub>min</sub></sub> &gt; <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i><sub>max</sub>+1</sub>. These ensure that there always exists an <i>n</i> satisfying the conditions.
</p>

<p>
The end of the input is represented by a line containing three zeros separated by single spaces.
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>


<p>
For each dataset, output the number of successful applicants in a line.
