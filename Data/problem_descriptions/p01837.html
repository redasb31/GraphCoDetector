<h2>Longest Shortest Path</h2>

<p>
You are given a directed graph and two nodes $s$ and $t$. The given graph may contain multiple edges between the same node pair but not self loops. Each edge $e$ has its initial length $d_e$ and the cost $c_e$. You can extend an edge by paying a cost. Formally, it costs $x \cdot c_e$ to change the length of an edge $e$ from $d_e$ to $d_e + x$. (Note that $x$ can be a non-integer.) Edges cannot be shortened.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to maximize the length of the shortest path from node $s$ to node $t$ by lengthening some edges within cost $P$. You can assume that there is at least one path from $s$ to $t$.
</p>


<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input consists of a single test case formatted as follows.<br/>
<br/>
$N$ $M$ $P$ $s$ $t$<br/>
$v_1$ $u_1$ $d_1$ $c_1$<br/>
...<br/>
$v_M$ $u_M$ $d_M$ $c_M$<br/>
</p>

<p>
The first line contains five integers $N$, $M$, $P$, $s$, and $t$: $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 200$) and $M$ ($1 \leq M \leq 2,000$) are the number of the nodes and the edges of the given graph respectively, $P$ ($0 \leq P \leq 10^6$) is the cost limit that you can pay, and $s$ and $t$ ($1 \leq s, t \leq N, s \ne t$) are the start and the end node of objective path respectively. Each of the following $M$ lines contains four integers $v_i$, $u_i$, $d_i$, and $c_i$, which mean there is an edge from $v_i$ to $u_i$ ($1 \leq v_i, u_i \leq N, v_i \ne u_i$) with the initial length $d_i$ ($1 \leq d_i \leq 10$) and the cost $c_i$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq 10$).
</p>

<h3>Output</h3
<p>
Output the maximum length of the shortest path from node $s$ to node $t$ by lengthening some edges within cost $P$. The output can contain an absolute or a relative error no more than $10^{-6}$.
