<h1>Beautiful Sequence</h1>
<p>
Alice is spending his time on an independent study to apply to the Nationwide Mathematics Contest. This yearâ€™s theme is "Beautiful Sequence." As Alice is interested in the working of computers, she wants to create a beautiful sequence using only 0 and 1. She defines a "Beautiful" sequence of length $N$ that consists only of 0 and 1 if it includes $M$ successive array of 1s as its sub-sequence.
  
</p>
<p>
  Using his skills in programming, Alice decided to calculate how many "Beautiful sequences" she can generate and compile a report on it.
</p>

<p>
  Make a program to evaluate the possible number of "Beautiful sequences" given the sequence length $N$ and sub-sequence length $M$ that consists solely of 1. As the answer can be extremely large, divide it by $1,000,000,007 (= 10^9 + 7)$ and output the remainder.
  </p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
  The input is given in the following format.
</p>
<pre>
$N$ $M$  
</pre>
<p>
The input line provides the length of sequence $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$) and the length $M$ ($1 \leq M \leq N$) of the array that solely consists of 1s.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
  Output the number of Beautiful sequences in a line.
</p>


<h2>Sample Input 1</h2>
<pre>
4 3
</pre>
<h2>Sample Output 1</h2>
<pre>
3
</pre>
<p>
  The sequences with length 4 that include 1s in successive array of length 3 are: 0111, 1110 and 1111.
</p>

<h2>Sample Input 2</h2>
<pre>
4 2
</pre>
<h2>Sample Output 2</h2>
<pre>
8
</pre>
<p>
  The sequences with length 4 that include 1s in successive array of length 2 are: 0011, 0110, 0111, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110 and 1111.
