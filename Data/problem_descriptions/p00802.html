<p>
Dr. Extreme experimentally made an extremely precise telescope to investigate extremely curi- ous phenomena at an extremely distant place. In order to make the telescope so precise as to investigate phenomena at such an extremely distant place, even quite a small distortion is not allowed. However, he forgot the influence of the internal gas affected by low-frequency vibration of magnetic flux passing through the telescope. The cylinder of the telescope is not affected by the low-frequency vibration, but the internal gas is.
</p>
<p>
The cross section of the telescope forms a perfect circle. If he forms a coil by putting extremely thin wire along the (inner) circumference, he can measure (the average vertical component of) the temporal variation of magnetic flux:such measurement would be useful to estimate the influence. But points on the circumference at which the wire can be fixed are limited; furthermore, the number of special clips to fix the wire is also limited. To obtain the highest sensitivity, he wishes to form a coil of a polygon shape with the largest area by stringing the wire among carefully selected points on the circumference.

Your job is to write a program which reports the maximum area of all possible <i>m</i>-polygons (polygons with exactly <i>m</i> vertices) each of whose vertices is one of the <i>n</i> points given on a circumference with a radius of 1. An example of the case <i>n</i> = 4 and <i>m</i> = 3 is illustrated below.

In the figure above, the equations such as "<i>p</i><sub>1</sub> = 0.0" indicate the locations of the <i>n</i> given points, and the decimals such as "1.000000" on <i>m</i>-polygons indicate the areas of <i>m</i>-polygons.
</p>
<p>
Parameter <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> denotes the location of the <i>i</i>-th given point on the circumference (1 &le; <i>i</i> &le; <i>n</i>). The location <i>p</i> of a point on the circumference is in the range 0 &le; <i>p</i> &lt; 1, corresponding to the range of rotation angles from 0 to 2<i>&pi;</i> radians. That is, the rotation angle of a point at <i>p</i> to the point at 0 equals 2<i>&pi;</i> radians. (<i>&pi;</i> is the circular constant 3.14159265358979323846....)
</p>
<p>
You may rely on the fact that the area of an isosceles triangle ABC (AB = AC = 1) with an interior angle BAC of <i>&alpha;</i> radians (0 &lt; <i>&alpha;</i> &lt; <i>&pi;</i>) is (1/2)sin<i>&alpha;</i>, and the area of a polygon inside a circle with a radius of 1 is less than <i>&pi;</i>.
 
<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple subproblems followed by a line containing two zeros that indicates the end of the input. Each subproblem is given in the following format.
</p>
<pre>
<i>n m</i>
<i>p</i><sub>1</sub> <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> ... <i>p</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>
</pre>
<p>
<i>n</i> is the number of points on the circumference (3 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 40). <i>m</i> is the number of vertices to form <i>m</i>-polygons (3 &le; <i>m</i> &le; <i>n</i>). The locations of <i>n</i> points, <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>,..., <i>p<sub>n</sub></i>, are given as decimals and they are separated by either a space character or a newline. In addition, you may assume that 0 &le; <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> &lt; <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> &lt; ... &lt; <i>p<sub>n</sub></i> &lt; 1.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each subproblem, the maximum area should be output, each in a separate line. Each value in the output may not have an error greater than 0.000001 and its fractional part should be represented by 6 decimal digits after the decimal point.
