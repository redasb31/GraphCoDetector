<font color="#000">Problem D:</font> Circle and Points
</H1>


<P>
You are given <i>N</i> points in the <i>xy</i>-plane. You have a
circle of radius one and move it on the <i>xy</i>-plane, so as to
enclose as many of the points as possible. Find how many points can be
simultaneously enclosed at the maximum. A point is considered
<em>enclosed</em> by a circle when it is inside or on the circle.

<H2>Input</H2>


<P>
The input consists of a series of data sets, followed by a single line
only containing a single character '0', which indicates the end of the
input.  Each data set begins with a line containing an integer <i>N</i>,
which indicates the number of points in the data set. It is
followed by <i>N</i> lines describing the coordinates of the
points. Each of the <i>N</i> lines has two decimal fractions <i>X</i>
and <i>Y</i>, describing the <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>-coordinates of a
point, respectively. They are given with five digits after the decimal
point.
</P>



<P>
You may assume 1 &lt;= <i>N</i> &lt;= 300,  0.0 &lt;= <i>X</i> &lt;= 10.0, and 0.0
&lt;= <i>Y</i> &lt;= 10.0. No two points are closer than 0.0001.  No two
points in a data set are approximately at a distance of 2.0. More
precisely, for any two points in a data set, the distance <i>d</i>
between the two never satisfies 1.9999 &lt;= <i>d</i> &lt;= 2.0001. Finally,
no three points in a data set are simultaneously very close to a
single circle of radius one. More precisely,
let P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, and P<sub>3</sub> be any three points in a
data set, and <i>d</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>d</i><sub>2</sub>, and <i>d</i><sub>3</sub>
the distances from an arbitrarily selected point in the <i>xy</i>-plane to each of them
respectively. Then it never simultaneously holds that 0.9999 &lt;=
<i>d</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> &lt;= 1.0001 (<i>i</i> = 1, 2, 3).
</P>


<H2>Output</H2>


<P>
For each data set, print a single line containing the maximum number
of points in the data set that can be simultaneously enclosed by a
circle of radius one. No other characters including leading and
trailing spaces should be printed.
