<p>
 There are a number of ways to shuffle a deck of cards.  Riffle shuffle is one such example.  The following is how to perform riffle shuffle.
</p>
<p>
  There is a deck of <i>n</i> cards.  First, we divide it into two decks; deck A which consists of the top half of it and deck B of the bottom half.  Deck A will have one more card when <i>n</i> is odd. 
</p>
<p>
  Next, <i>c</i> cards are pulled from bottom of deck A and are stacked on deck C, which is empty initially.  Then <i>c</i> cards are pulled from bottom of deck B and stacked on deck C, likewise.  This operation is repeated until deck A and B become empty.  When the number of cards of deck A(B) is less than <i>c</i>, all cards are pulled.
  Finally we obtain shuffled deck C.  See an example below:
</p>

<pre>
  - A single riffle operation where n = 9, c = 3
    
    for given deck [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]  (right is top)

    - Step 0
    deck A [4 5 6 7 8]
    deck B [0 1 2 3]
    deck C []

    - Step 1
    deck A [7 8]
    deck B [0 1 2 3]
    deck C [4 5 6]

    - Step 2
    deck A [7 8]
    deck B [3]
    deck C [4 5 6 0 1 2]

    - Step 3
    deck A []
    deck B [3]
    deck C [4 5 6 0 1 2 7 8]

    - Step 4
    deck A []
    deck B []
    deck C [4 5 6 0 1 2 7 8 3]

    shuffled deck [4 5 6 0 1 2 7 8 3]
</pre>
<p>
  This operation, called riffle operation, is repeated several times.
</p>

<p>
  Write a program that simulates Riffle shuffle and answer which card will be finally placed on the top of the deck.
</p>


<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
 The input consists of multiple data sets. Each data set starts with a line containing two positive integers <i>n</i>(1 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 50) and <i>r</i>(1 &le; <i>r</i> &le; 50); <i>n</i> and <i>r</i> are the number of cards in the deck and the number of riffle operations, respectively.
</p>
<p>
  <i>r</i> more positive integers follow, each of which represents a riffle operation. These riffle operations are performed in the listed order.  Each integer represents <i>c</i>, which is explained above.
</p>
<p>
  The end of the input is indicated by EOF. The number of data sets is less than 100.<!--a line which contains two zeros.-->
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
 For each data set in the input, your program should print the number of the top card after the shuffle.  Assume that at the beginning the cards are numbered from 0 to <i>n</i>-1, from the bottom to the top.  Each number should be written in a sparate line without any superfluous characters such as leading or following spaces.
