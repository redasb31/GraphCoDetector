<font color="#000">Problem A:</font> Hanafuda Shuffle
</h1>

<p>
There are a number of ways to shuffle a deck of cards.   Hanafuda 
shuffling for Japanese card game 'Hanafuda' is one such example.
The following is how to perform Hanafuda shuffling.

</p>

<p>
There is a deck of <I>n</I> cards. Starting from the <I>p</I>-th card 
from the top of the deck, <I>c</I> cards are pulled out
and put on the top of the deck, as shown in Figure 1.
This operation, called a cutting operation, is repeated.
</p>

<p>
Write a program that simulates Hanafuda shuffling and answers which 
card will be finally placed on the top of the deck.

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple data sets.
Each data set starts with a line containing two positive integers <I>n</I> 
(1 &lt;= <I>n</I> &lt;= 50) and <I>r</I> (1 &lt;= <I>r</I> &lt;= 50); <I>n</I> and 
 <I>r</I> are the number of cards in the deck and the number of cutting 
operations, respectively.
</p>


<p>
 There are <I>r</I> more lines in the data set, each of which
 represents a cutting operation. These cutting operations 
are performed in the listed order.
Each line contains two positive integers <I>p</I> and <I>c</I> 
(<I>p</I> + <I>c</I> &lt;= <I>n</I> + 1).
Starting from the <I>p</I>-th card from the top of the deck, <I>c</I>
cards should be pulled out and put on the top.
</p>



<p>
The end of the input is indicated by a line which contains two zeros.
</p>


<p>
Each input line contains exactly two integers separated by a space 
character.
There are no other characters in the line.
</p>


<h2>Output</h2>

<p> 
For each data set in the input, your program 
should write the number of the top card after the shuffle.
Assume that at the beginning the cards 
are numbered from 1 to <I>n</I>, from the bottom to the top.
Each number should be written in a separate line 
without any superfluous characters such as leading or following spaces.
