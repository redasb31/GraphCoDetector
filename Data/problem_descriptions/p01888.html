<h2>Multisect</h2>

<p>
We are developing the world's coolest AI robot product. After the long struggle, we finally managed to send our product at revision $R_{RC}$ to QA team as a release candidate. However, they reported that some tests failed! Because we were too lazy to set up a continuous integration system, we have no idea when our software corrupted. We only know that the software passed all the test at the past revision $R_{PASS}$. To determine the revision $R_{ENBUG}$ ($R_{PASS} < R_{ENBUG} \leq R_{RC}$) in which our software started to fail, we must test our product revision-by-revision.
</p>

<p>
Here, we can assume the following conditions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> When we test at the revision $R$, the test passes if $R < R_{ENBUG}$, or fails otherwise.</li>
<li> It is equally possible, which revision between $R_{PASS} + 1$ and $R_{RC}$ is $R_{ENBUG}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>
From the first assumption, we don't need to test all the revisions. All we have to do is to find the revision $R$ such that the test at $R - 1$ passes and the test at $R$ fails. We have $K$ testing devices. Using them, we can test at most $K$ different revisions simultaneously. We call this "parallel testing". By the restriction of the testing environment, we cannot start new tests until a current parallel testing finishes, even if we don't use all the $K$ devices.
</p>

<p>
Parallel testings take some cost. The more tests fail, the more costly the parallel testing becomes. If $i$ tests fail in a parallel testing, its cost is $T_i$ ($0 \leq i \leq K$). And if we run parallel testings multiple times, the total cost is the sum of their costs.
</p>

<p>
Of course we want to minimize the total cost to determine $R_{ENBUG}$, by choosing carefully how many and which revisions to test on each parallel testing. What is the minimum expected value of the total cost if we take an optimal strategy?
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input consists of a single test case with the following format.<br/>
<br/>
$R_{PASS}$ $R_{RC}$ $K$<br/>
$T_0$ $T_1$ ... $T_K$
</p>

<p>
$R_{PASS}$ and $R_{RC}$ are integers that represent the revision numbers of our software at which the test passed and failed, respectively. $1 \leq R_{PASS} < R_{RC} \leq 1,000$ holds. $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq 30$) is the maximum number of revisions we can test in a single parallel testing. $T_i$ is an integer that represents the cost of a parallel testing in which $i$ tests fail ($0 \leq i \leq K$). You can assume $1 \leq T_0 \leq T_1 \leq ... \leq T_K \leq 100,000$.
