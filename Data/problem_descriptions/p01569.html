<h1>Sun and Moon</h1>

<p>In the year 20XX, mankind is hit by an unprecedented crisis.
The power balance  between the sun and the moon  was broken by the total eclipse of the sun, and the end is looming!
To save the world, the secret society called &quot;Sun and Moon&quot; decided to perform the ritual to balance the power of the sun and the moon called &quot;Ritual of Sun and Moon&quot;.
</p>
<p>The ritual consists of &quot;Ritual of Sun&quot; and &quot;Ritual of Moon&quot;. &quot;Ritual of Moon&quot; is performed after &quot;Ritual of Sun&quot;.
A member of the society is  divided into two groups, &quot;Messengers of Sun&quot; and &quot;Messengers of Moon&quot;.
Each member has some offerings and magic power.
</p>
<p>First, the society performs &quot;Ritual of Sun&quot;.
In the ritual, each member sacrifices an offering.
If he can not sacrifice an offering here, he will be killed.
After the sacrifice, his magic power is multiplied by the original number of his offerings.
Each member must perform the sacrifice just once.
</p>
<p>Second, the society performs &quot;Ritual of Moon&quot;.
In the ritual, each member sacrifices all remaining offerings.
After the sacrifice, his magic power is multiplied by <var>x<sup>p</sup></var>.
Here <var>x</var> is the number of days from the eclipse (the eclipse is 0th day) and <var>p</var> is the number of his sacrificed offerings.
Each member must perform the sacrifice just once.
</p>
<p>After two rituals, all &quot;Messengers of Sun&quot; and &quot;Messengers of Moon&quot; give all magic power to the &quot;magical reactor&quot;.
If the total power of &quot;Messengers of Sun&quot; and the total power of &quot;Messengers of Moon&quot; are equal,
the society will succeed in the ritual and save the world.
</p>
<p>It is very expensive to perform &quot;Ritual of Sun&quot;.
It may not be able to perform &quot;Ritual of Sun&quot; because the society is in financial trouble.
Please write a program to calculate the minimum number of days from the eclipse in which the society can succeed in &quot;Ritual of Sun and Moon&quot; whether &quot;Ritual of Sun&quot; can be performed or not.
The society cannot perform the ritual  on the eclipse day (0-th day).

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The format of the input is as follows.
</p>
<blockquote>
<var>N</var><br><var>O<sub>1</sub></var> <var>P<sub>1</sub></var><br><var>...</var><br><var>O<sub>N</sub></var> <var>P<sub>N</sub></var><br></blockquote>

<p>The first line contains an integer <var>N</var> that is the number of  members of the society (<var>0 &le; N &le; 1,000</var>).
</p>
<p>Each of the following <var>N</var> lines contains two integers <var>O<sub>i</sub></var> (<var>0 &le; O<sub>i</sub> &le; 1,000,000,000</var>) and <var>P<sub>i</sub></var> (<var>1 &le; |P<sub>i</sub>| &le; 1,000,000,000,000,000</var>).
<var>O<sub>i</sub></var> is the number of the <var>i</var>-th member's offerings and <var>|P<sub>i</sub>|</var> is the strength of  his magic power.
If <var>P<sub>i</sub></var> is a positive integer, the <var>i</var>-th member belongs to &quot;Messengers of Sun&quot;, otherwise he belongs to &quot;Messengers of Moon&quot;.
</p>


<h2>Output</h2>

<p>If  there exists the number of days from the eclipse that satisfies the above condition , print the minimum number of days  preceded by &quot;Yes &quot;.
Otherwise print &quot;No&quot;.
</p>
<p>Of course, the answer must be a positive integer.
