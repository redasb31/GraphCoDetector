<br><br>

<p>
  As shown in the figures, each face is identified by a different label from 1 to 6.
</p>

<p>
  Write a program which reads integers assigned to each face identified by the label and a sequence of commands to roll the dice, and prints the integer on the top face. At the initial state, the dice is located as shown in the above figures.
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
  In the first line, six integers assigned to faces are given in ascending order of their corresponding labels.
</p>

<p>
  In the second line, a string which represents a sequence of commands, is given. The command is one of '<span>E</span>', '<span>N</span>', '<span>S</span>' and '<span>W</span>' representing four directions shown in the above figures.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
  Print the integer which appears on the top face after the simulation.
</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>

<ul>
<li>$0 \leq $ the integer assigned to a face $ \leq 100$</li>
<li>$0 \leq $ the length of the command $\leq 100$</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Input 1</h2>
<pre>
1 2 4 8 16 32
SE
</pre>
<h2>Sample Output 1</h2>

<pre>
8
</pre>

<p>
You are given a dice where 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 are 32 are assigned to a face labeled by 1, 2, ..., 6 respectively. After you roll the dice to the direction <span>S</span> and then to the direction <span>E</span>, you can see 8 on the top face.
