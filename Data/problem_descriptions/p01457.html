<H1>Carpenters' Language</H1>

<p>
International Carpenters Professionals Company (ICPC) is a top construction company with a lot of expert carpenters.
What makes ICPC a top company is their original language.
</p>

<p>
The syntax of the language is simply given in CFG as follows:
</p>

<pre>
S -&gt; SS | (S) | )S( | &epsilon;
</pre>

<p>
In other words, a right parenthesis can be closed by a left parenthesis and a left parenthesis can be closed by a right parenthesis in this language.
</p>

<p>
Alex, a grad student mastering linguistics, decided to study ICPC's language. 
As a first step of the study, he needs to judge whether a text is well-formed in the language or not.
Then, he asked you, a great programmer, to write a program for the judgement.
</p>

<p>
Alex's request is as follows: You have an empty string S in the beginning, and construct longer string by inserting a sequence of '(' or ')' into the string.
You will receive <var>q</var> queries, each of which consists of three elements <var>(p, c, n)</var>, where <var>p</var> is 
the position to insert, <var>n</var> is the number of characters to insert and <var>c</var> is either '(' or ')', the character to insert.
For each query, your program should insert <var>c</var> repeated by <var>n</var> times into the <var>p</var>-th position of S from the beginning.
Also it should output, after performing each insert operation, &quot;Yes&quot; if S is in the language and &quot;No&quot; if S is not in the language.
</p>

<p>
Please help Alex to support his study, otherwise he will fail to graduate the college.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The first line contains one integer <var>q</var> (<var>1 \leq q \leq 10^5</var>) indicating the number of queries, follows 
<var>q</var> lines of three elements, <var>p_i</var>, <var>c_i</var>, <var>n_i</var>, separated by a single space (<var>1 \leq i \leq q</var>, <var>c_i = '(' or ')'</var>, 
<var>0 \leq p_i \leq </var> length of S before <var>i</var>-th query, <var>1 \leq n \leq 2^{20}</var>).
It is guaranteed that all the queries in the input are valid.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each query, output &quot;Yes&quot; if S is in the language and &quot;No&quot; if S is not in the language.
