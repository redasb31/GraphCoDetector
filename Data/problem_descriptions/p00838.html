<p>
There are several colored cubes. All of them are of the same size but they may be colored
differently. Each face of these cubes has a single color. Colors of distinct faces of a cube may or
may not be the same.
</p>
<p>
Two cubes are said to be <i>identically</i> colored if some suitable rotations of one of the cubes give
identical looks to both of the cubes. For example, two cubes shown in Figure 2 are identically
colored. A set of cubes is said to be identically colored if every pair of them are identically
colored.
</p>
<p>
A cube and its mirror image are not necessarily identically colored. For example, two cubes
shown in Figure 3 are not identically colored.
</p>
<p>
You can make a given set of cubes identically colored by repainting some of the faces, whatever
colors the faces may have. In Figure 4, repainting four faces makes the three cubes identically
colored and repainting fewer faces will never do.
</p>
<p>
Your task is to write a program to calculate the minimum number of faces that needs to be
repainted for a given set of cubes to become identically colored.

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input is a sequence of datasets. A dataset consists of a header and a body appearing in this
order. A header is a line containing one positive integer n and the body following it consists
of <i>n</i> lines. You can assume that 1 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 4. Each line in a body contains six color names
separated by a space. A color name consists of a word or words connected with a hyphen (-).
A word consists of one or more lowercase letters. You can assume that a color name is at most
24-characters long including hyphens.
</p>
<p>
A dataset corresponds to a set of colored cubes. The integer n corresponds to the number of
cubes. Each line of the body corresponds to a cube and describes the colors of its faces. Color
names in a line is ordered in accordance with the numbering of faces shown in Figure 5. A line
</p>
<pre>
      <i>color</i><sub>1</sub> <i>color</i><sub>2</sub> <i>color</i><sub>3</sub> <i>color</i><sub>4</sub> <i>color</i><sub>5</sub> <i>color</i><sub>6</sub>
</pre
<p>
corresponds to a cube colored as shown in Figure 6.
</p>

<p>
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing a single zero. It is not a dataset nor a
part of a dataset.

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each dataset, output a line containing the minimum number of faces that need to be repainted
to make the set of cubes identically colored.
