<p>
Edward Leven loves multiples of eleven very much. When he sees a number, he always tries
to find consecutive subsequences (or substrings) forming multiples of eleven. He calls such
subsequences as 11-sequences. For example, he can find an 11-sequence 781 in a number 17819.
</p>

<p>
He thinks a number which has many 11-sequences is a <i>good</i> number. He would like to find out
a very <i>good</i> number. As the first step, he wants an easy way to count how many 11-sequences
are there in a given number. Even for him, counting them from a big number is not easy.
Fortunately, one of his friends, you, is a brilliant programmer. He asks you to write a program
to count the number of 11-sequences. Note that an 11-sequence must be a positive number
without leading zeros.

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input is a sequence of lines each of which contains a number consisting of less than or equal
to 80000 digits.
</p>

<p>
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing a single zero, which should not be processed.
</p>


<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each input number, output a line containing the number of 11-sequences.
</p>

<p>
You can assume the answer fits in a 32-bit signed integer.
