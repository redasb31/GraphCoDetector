<p>
T.I. Financial Group, a world-famous group of finance companies, has decided to hold an evil gambling
game in which insolvent debtors compete for special treatment of exemption from their debts.
</p>
<p>
In this game, each debtor starts from one cell on the stage called the Deadly Ring. The Deadly Ring
consists of N cells and each cell is colored black or red. Each cell is connected to exactly two other
adjacent cells and all the cells form a ring. At the start of the game, each debtor chooses which cell to
start. Then he rolls a die and moves on the ring in clockwise order by cells as many as the number of
spots shown on the upside of the die. This step is called a round, and each debtor repeats a round <i>T</i> times.
A debtor will be exempted from his debt if he is standing on a red cell after he finishes all the rounds.
On the other hand, if he finishes the game at a black cell, he will be sent somewhere else and forced to
devote his entire life to hard labor.
</p>
<p>
You have happened to take part in this game. As you are allowed to choose the starting cell, you want to
start from a cell that maximizes the probability of finishing the game at a red cell. Fortunately you can
bring a laptop PC to the game stage, so you have decided to write a program that calculates the maximum
winning probability.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple datasets.
</p>
<p>
Each dataset consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 2000) and <i>T</i> (1 &le; <i>T</i> &le; 2000) in this order, delimited with a single space. The second line contains a string of <i>N</i> characters that
consists of characters ‘<span>R</span>’ and ‘<span>B</span>’, which indicate red and black respectively. This string represents the
colors of the cells in clockwise order.
</p>
<p>
The input is terminated by a line with two zeros. This is not part of any datasets and should not be
processed.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each dataset, print the maximum probability of finishing the game at a red cell in one line. Your
program may output an arbitrary number of digits after the decimal point, provided that the absolute
error does not exceed 10<sup>-8</sup>.
