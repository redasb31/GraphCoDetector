<H1>Network Reliability</H1>

<p>
An undirected graph is given.
Each edge of the graph disappears with a constant probability.
Calculate the probability with which the remained graph is connected.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The first line contains three integers <var>N</var> (<var>1 \leq N \leq 14</var>), <var>M</var> (<var>0 \leq M \leq 100</var>) and <var>P</var> (<var>0 \leq P \leq 100</var>), separated by a single space.
<var>N</var> is the number of the vertices and <var>M</var> is the number of the edges. <var>P</var> is the probability represented by a percentage.
</p>

<p>
The following <var>M</var> lines describe the edges.
Each line contains two integers <var>v_i</var> and <var>u_i</var> (<var>1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq N</var>).
(<var>u_i, v_i</var>) indicates the edge that connects the two vertices <var>u_i</var> and <var>v_i</var>.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
Output a line containing the probability with which the remained graph is connected.
Your program may output an arbitrary number of digits after the decimal point. However, the absolute error should be <var>10^{-9}</var> or less.
