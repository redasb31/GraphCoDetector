<h2>Problem I:
Tampopo Machine
</h2>

<p>
  "Today is another day of endless, tedious work to put a tampopo on sashimi..."
</p>

<p>
  Yaruo works in a sashimi (sliced raw fish) factory. His job is to put tampopos on sashimi packages everyday. Tired of this menial job, he decided to develop a tampopo machine to do the job instead of him.
</p>

<p>
  The tampopo machine has the following properties. Sashimi packages are put on a conveyor belt and move from left to right. The width of a package is $W$ and the interval between two adjacent packages is $D$. The machine has $N$ magic hands placed above the conveyor belt at regular intervals of $M$. These magic hands put tampopos every $T$ seconds.
</p>

<p>
  In initial state, the right end of the first package is under the leftmost magic hand. The magic hands start putting a tampopo as soon as he turns on the power of the machine. The conveyor belt moves one unit length per one second.

<br>

<p>
  Unfortunately, after building the machine, Yaruo noticed that there exist some packages with no tampopos. Calculate the ratio of packages with no tampopos for him.
</p>

<p>
When a magic hand puts a tampopo on the left or right end of a package, you can assume that the tampopo is on the package.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
  The input consists of 5 integers, $W$, $D$, $N$, $M$ and $T$ which are described in the problem statement.<br>
  
($1 \leq W, D, N, M, T \leq 1,000,000,000$)
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
Output the ratio of packages with no tampopos in a line. The absolute error should be less than or equal to $10^{-9}$.
</p>
