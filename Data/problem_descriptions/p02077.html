<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>JAG land is a country, which is represented as an $M \times M$ grid. Its top-left cell is $(1, 1)$ and its bottom-right cell is $(M, M)$.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bomber invaded JAG land and dropped bombs to the country. Its bombing pattern is always fixed and represented by an $N \times N$ grid. Each symbol in the bombing pattern is either <code>X</code> or <code>.</code>. The meaning of each symbol is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>X</code>: Bomb </li>
<li><code>.</code>: Empty</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, suppose that a bomber is in $(br, bc)$ in the land and drops a bomb. The cell $(br + i - 1, bc + j - 1)$ will be damaged if the symbol in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column of the bombing pattern is <code>X</code> ($1 \le i, j \le N$).</p>
<p>Initially, the bomber reached $(1, 1)$ in JAG land. The bomber repeated to move to either of $4$-directions and then dropped a bomb just $L$ times. During this attack, the values of the coordinates of the bomber were between $1$ and $M - N + 1$, inclusive, while it dropped bombs. Finally, the bomber left the country.</p>
<p>The moving pattern of the bomber is described as $L$ characters. The $i$-th character corresponds to the $i$-th move and the meaning of each character is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>U</code>: Up</li>
<li><code>D</code>: Down</li>
<li><code>L</code>: Left</li>
<li><code>R</code>: Right</li>
</ul>
<p>Your task is to write a program to analyze the damage situation in JAG land. To investigate damage overview in the land, calculate the number of cells which were damaged by the bomber at least $K$ times.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input consists of a single test case in the format below.</p>
<blockquote>$N$ $M$ $K$ $L$
$B_{1}$
$\vdots$
$B_{N}$
$S$</blockquote>
<p>The first line contains four integers $N$, $M$, $K$ and $L$($1 \le N &lt; M \le 500$, $1 \le K \le L \le 2 \times 10^{5}$).
The following $N$ lines represent the bombing pattern.
$B_i$ is a string of length $N$. Each character of $B_i$ is either <code>X</code> or <code>.</code>. The last line denotes the moving pattern. 
$S$ is a string of length $L$, which consists of either <code>U</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>L</code> or <code>R</code>. 
It's guaranteed that the values of the coordinates of the bomber are between $1$ and $M - N + 1$, inclusive, while it drops bombs in the country.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print the number of cells which were damaged by the bomber at least $K$ times.</p>
