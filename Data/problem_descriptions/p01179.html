<p>
Sarah is a girl who likes reading books.
</p>
<p>
One day, she wondered about the relationship of a family in a mystery novel. The story said,
</p>

<ul>
<li>B is A’s father’s brother’s son, and</li>
<li>C is B’s aunt.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then she asked herself, “So how many degrees of kinship are there between A and C?”
</p>
<p>
There are two possible relationships between B and C, that is, C is either B’s father’s sister or
B’s mother’s sister in the story. If C is B’s father’s sister, C is in the third degree of kinship to
A (A’s father’s sister). On the other hand, if C is B’s mother’s sister, C is in the fifth degree of
kinship to A (A’s father’s brother’s wife’s sister).
</p>
<p>
You are a friend of Sarah’s and good at programming. You can help her by writing a general
program to calculate the maximum and minimum degrees of kinship between A and C under
given relationship.
</p>
<p>
The relationship of A and C is represented by a sequence of the following basic relations: father,
mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, grandson,
granddaughter, uncle, aunt, nephew, and niece. Here are some descriptions about these relations:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>X</i>’s brother is equivalent to <i>X</i>’s father’s or mother’s son not identical to <i>X</i>.</li>
<li><i>X</i>’s grandfather is equivalent to <i>X</i>’s father’s or mother’s father.</li>
<li><i>X</i>’s grandson is equivalent to <i>X</i>’s son’s or daughter’s son.</li>
<li><i>X</i>’s uncle is equivalent to <i>X</i>’s father’s or mother’s brother.</li>
<li><i>X</i>’s nephew is equivalent to <i>X</i>’s brother’s or sister’s son.</li>
<li>Similar rules apply to sister, grandmother, granddaughter, aunt and niece.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this problem, you can assume there are none of the following relations in the family: adoptions,
marriages between relatives (i.e. the family tree has no cycles), divorces, remarriages, bigamous
marriages and same-sex marriages.
</p>

<p>
The degree of kinship is defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> The distance from <i>X</i> to <i>X</i>’s father, <i>X</i>’s mother, <i>X</i>’s son or <i>X</i>’s daughter is one.</li>
<li> The distance from <i>X</i> to <i>X</i>’s husband or <i>X</i>’s wife is zero.</li>
<li> The degree of kinship between <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> is equal to the shortest distance from <i>X</i> to <i>Y</i>
  deduced from the above rules.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input contains multiple datasets. The first line consists of a positive integer that indicates
the number of datasets.
</p>
<p>
Each dataset is given by one line in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
      C is A(’s <i>relation</i>)*
</pre>
<p>
Here, <i>relation</i> is one of the following:
</p>
<pre>
father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, brother,
sister, grandfather, grandmother, grandson, granddaughter, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece.
</pre>
<p>
An asterisk denotes zero or more occurance of portion surrounded by the parentheses. The
number of relations in each dataset is at most ten.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each dataset, print a line containing the maximum and minimum degrees of kinship separated
by exact one space. No extra characters are allowed of the output.
</p>
