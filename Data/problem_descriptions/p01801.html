<h2>Problem L
Wall Making Game</h2>

<p>
The game <i>Wall Making Game</i>, a two-player board game, is all the rage.
</p>

<p>
This game is played on an $H \times W$ board. Each cell of the board is one of <i>empty</i>, <i>marked</i>, or <i>wall</i>. At the beginning of the game, there is no wall on the board.
</p>

<p>
In this game, two players alternately move as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> A player chooses one of the empty cells (not marked and not wall). If the player can't choose a cell, he loses.</li>
<li> Towards each of the four directions (upper, lower, left, and right) from the chosen cell, the player changes cells (including the chosen cell) to walls until the player first reaches a wall or the outside of the board.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that marked cells cannot be chosen in step 1, but they can be changed to walls in step 2.
</p>

<p>
Fig.1 shows an example of a move in which a player chooses the cell at the third row and the fourth
column.

<p>
Your task is to write a program that determines which player wins the game if the two players play optimally from a given initial board.
</p>


<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
The first line of the input consists of two integers $H$ and $W$ $(1 \leq H, W \leq 20)$, where $H$ and $W$ are the height and the width of the board respectively. The following $H$ lines represent the initial board. Each of the $H$ lines consists of $W$ characters.
</p>

<p>
The $j$-th character of the $i$-th line is '<span>.</span>' if the cell at the $j$-th column of the $i$-th row is empty, or '<span>X</span>' if the cell is marked.
</p>



<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
Print "<span>First</span>" (without the quotes) in a line if the first player wins the given game. Otherwise, print "<span>Second</span>" (also without the quotes) in a line.
</p>
