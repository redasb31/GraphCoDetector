<!-- Problem F-->
<p>
In a forest, there lived a spider named Tim. Tim was so smart that he created a huge, well-structured web.
Surprisingly, his web forms a set of equilateral and concentric <i>N</i>-sided polygons whose edge lengths
form an arithmetic sequence.

</center>

<p>
Corresponding vertices of the N-sided polygons lie on a straight line, each apart from neighboring ver-
tices by distance 1. Neighboring vertices are connected by a thread (shown in the figure as solid lines),
on which Tim can walk (you may regard Tim as a point). Radial axes are numbered from 1 to <i>N</i> in a
rotational order, so you can denote by (<i>r</i>, <i>i</i>) the vertex on axis <i>i</i> and apart from the center of the web by
distance <i>r</i>. You may consider the web as infinitely large, i.e. consisting of infinite number of <i>N</i>-sided
polygons, since the web is so gigantic.
</p>
<p>
Tim’s web is thus marvelous, but currently has one problem: due to rainstorms, some of the threads are
damaged and Tim can’t walk on those parts.
</p>
<p>
Now, a bug has been caught on the web. Thanks to the web having so organized a structure, Tim accu-
rately figures out where the bug is, and heads out for that position. You, as a biologist, are interested in
whether Tim is smart enough to move through the shortest possible route. To judge that, however, you
need to know the length of the shortest route yourself, and thereby decided to write a program which
calculates that length.

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers <i>N</i>
(3 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) and <i>X</i> (0 &le; <i>X</i> &le; 100), where <i>N</i> is as described above and <i>X</i> denotes the number of
damaged threads. Next line contains four integers <i>r<sub>S</sub></i>, <i>i<sub>S</sub></i>, <i>r<sub>T</sub></i>, and <i>i<sub>T</sub></i>, meaning that Tim is starting at (<i>r<sub>S</sub></i>, <i>i<sub>S</sub></i>) and the bug is at (<i>r<sub>T</sub></i>, <i>i<sub>T</sub></i>). This line is followed by <i>X</i> lines, each containing four integers <i>r<sub>A</sub></i>, <i>i<sub>A</sub></i>, <i>r<sub>B</sub></i>, and
<i>i<sub>B</sub></i>, meaning that a thread connecting (<i>r<sub>A</sub></i>, <i>i<sub>A</sub></i>) and (<i>r<sub>B</sub></i>, <i>i<sub>B</sub></i>) is damaged. Here (<i>r<sub>A</sub></i>, <i>i<sub>A</sub></i>) and (<i>r<sub>B</sub></i>, <i>i<sub>B</sub></i>) will be
always neighboring to each other. Also, for all vertices (<i>r</i>, <i>i</i>) given above, you may assume 1 &le; <i>r</i> &le; 10<sup>7</sup>
and 1 &le; <i>i</i> &le; <i>N</i>.
</p>

<p>
There will be at most 200 test cases. You may also assume that Tim is always able to reach where the
bug is.
</p>
<p>
The input is terminated by a line containing two zeros.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each test case, print the length of the shortest route in a line. You may print any number of digits
after the decimal point, but the error must not be greater than 0.01.
