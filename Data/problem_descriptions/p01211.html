<p>
There are a fixed circle (indicated by <i>A</i> in the figure) and a smaller interior circle with some
pinholes (indicated by <i>B</i>). By putting a pen point through one of the pinholes and then rolling
the circle <i>B</i> without slipping around the inside of the circle <i>A</i>, we can draw curves as illustrated
below. Such curves are called <i>hypotrochoids</i>.

<p>
Your task is to write a program that calculates the length of hypotrochoid, given the radius of
the fixed circle <i>A</i>, the radius of the interior circle <i>B</i>, and the distance between the <i>B</i>â€™s centroid and the used pinhole.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case is described by a single line in which
three integers <i>P</i>, <i>Q</i> and <i>R</i> appear in this order, where <i>P</i> is the radius of the fixed circle <i>A</i>, <i>Q</i>
is the radius of the interior circle <i>B</i>, and <i>R</i> is the distance between the centroid of the circle <i>B</i>
and the pinhole. You can assume that 0 &le; <i>R</i> &lt; <i>Q</i> &lt; <i>P</i> &le; 1000. <i>P</i>, <i>Q</i>, and <i>R</i> are separated by
a single space, while no other spaces appear in the input.
</p>
<p>
The end of input is indicated by a line with <i>P</i> = <i>Q</i> = <i>R</i> = 0.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each test case, output the length of the hypotrochoid curve. The error must be within
10<sup>-2</sup> (= 0.01).
