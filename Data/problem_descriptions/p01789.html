<h2>J - Unfair Game</h2>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
Rabbit Hanako and Fox Jiro are great friends going to JAG primary school. Today they decided to play the following game during the lunch break. 
</p>

<p>
This game is played by two players with $N$ heaps of some number of stones. The players alternatively take their turn to play the game. Jiro is a kind gentleman, so he yielded the first turn to Hanako. In each turn, the player must take some stones, satisfying the following conditions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If the player is Hanako, she must take between $1$ to $A$ stones, inclusive, from a heap.</li>
<li>If the player is Jiro, he must take between $1$ to $B$ stones, inclusive, from a heap.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The winner is the player who takes the last stone. Jiro thinks it is rude to go easy on her because he is a perfect gentleman. Therefore, he does him best. Of course, Hanako also does so.
</p>

<p>
Jiro is worried that he may lose the game. Being a cadet teacher working at JAG primary school as well as a professional competitive programmer, you should help him by programming. Your task is to write a program calculating the winner, assuming that they both play optimally.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
The first line contains three integers $N$, $A$, and $B$. $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$) is the number of heaps. $A$ and $B$ ($1 \leq A, B \leq 10^9$) are the maximum numbers of stones that Hanako and Jiro can take in a turn, respectively. Then $N$ lines follow, each of which contains a single integer $S_i$ ($1 \leq S_i \leq 10^9$), representing the number of stones in the $i$-th heap at the beginning of the game.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Output a line with &quot;Hanako&quot; if Hanako wins the game or &quot;Jiro&quot; in the other case. </p>
