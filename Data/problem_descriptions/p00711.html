<H1><font color="#000">Problem B:</font> Red and Black</H1>

<P>
 There is a rectangular room, covered with square tiles. Each tile is
colored either red or black. A man is standing on a black tile.
From a tile, he can move to one of four adjacent tiles. But he can't 
move on red tiles, he can move only on black tiles.
</P>

<P>
 Write a program to count the number of black tiles which he can reach 
by repeating the moves described above. 
</P>


<H2>Input</H2>


<P>
 The input consists of multiple data sets.
 A data set starts with a line containing two positive integers <I>W</I> and <I>H</I>;
 <I>W</I> and <I>H</I> are the numbers of tiles in the <I>x</I>-
 and <I>y</I>- directions, respectively. <I>W</I> and <I>H</I> are 
not more than 20.
</P>



<P>
  There are <I>H</I> more lines in the data set, each of which
includes <I>W</I> characters. Each character represents the color of a
tile as follows.
</P>

<ul>
<li>'.' - a black tile
<li>'#' - a red tile
<li>'@' - a man on a black tile(appears exactly once in a data set)
</ul>



<p>
The end of the input is indicated by a line consisting of two zeros.
</p>


<H2>Output</H2>


<P>
  For each data set, your program 
should output a line which contains the number of 
tiles he can reach from the initial tile (including itself).
</P>
