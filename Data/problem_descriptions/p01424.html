<H1>Palindrome Generator</H1>

<p>
A palidrome craftsperson starts to work in the early morning, 
with the clear air allowing him to polish up his palindromes.
</p>

<p>
On this morning, he is making his pieces to submit to the International Contest for Palindrome Craftspeople.
</p>

<p>
By the way, in order to make palindromes, he uses a special dictionary which contains a set of words and a set of ordered pairs of the words.
Any words and any ordered pairs of consecutive words in his palindromes must appear in the dictionary.
</p>

<p>
We already have his dictionary, so let's estimate how long a palindrome he can make.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The first line in the data set consists of two integers <var>N</var> (<var>1 \leq N \leq 100</var>) and <var>M</var> (<var>0 \leq M \leq 1\,000</var>).
<var>N</var> describes the number of words in the dictionary and <var>M</var> describes the number of ordered pairs of words.
</p>

<p>
The following <var>N</var> lines describe the words he can use.
The <var>i</var>-th line (<var>1</var>-based) contains the word <var>i</var>, which consists of only lower-case letters and whose length is between <var>1</var> and <var>10</var>, inclusive.
</p>

<p>
The following <var>M</var> lines describe the ordered pairs of consecutive words he can use.
The <var>j</var>-th line (<var>1</var>-based) contains two integers <var>X_j</var> and <var>Y_j</var> (<var>1 \leq X_j, Y_j \leq N</var>).
<var>X_j</var> describes the (<var>1</var>-based) index of the former word in the palindrome and <var>Y_j</var> describes that of the latter word.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
Print the maximal length of the possible palindrome in a line.
If he can make no palidromes, print &quot;0&quot;.
If he can make arbitrary long palindromes, print &quot;-1&quot;.
