<p>
Alice, your girlfriend, is a student at an art school. She is in the final year, and now working
hard to build a facture for fulfilling the requirement to graduate. Her work is a large pinball
with many straight slopes. Before starting to build, she has made several plans, but is unsure if
they work as expected. So she asked you, a professional programmer, for help.
</p>
<p>
You have modeled this situation by a two dimensional plane with some line segments on it. In
this model, there is gravitation downward, i.e., in the decreasing direction of <i>y</i>-coordinate. Your
task is to write a program that simulates the pinball, and compute the last position where the
ball crosses the <i>x</i>-axis.
</p>
<p>
You may assume coefficient of restitution between the slopes and the ball is 0, i.e., when the ball
collides a slope, it instantly loses the velocity component orthogonal to the slope. And since her
pinball is so large, you may also assume that the volume of the ball is negligible.

</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple data sets. Each data set is given in the format below.
</p>
<pre>
      <i>N</i>
      <i>g</i>
      <i>x y</i>
      <i>x</i><sub>1,1</sub> <i>y</i><sub>1,1</sub> <i>x</i><sub>1,2</sub> <i>y</i><sub>1,2</sub>
      ...
      <i>x</i><sub><i>N</i>,1</sub> <i>y</i><sub><i>N</i>,1</sub> <i>x</i><sub><i>N</i>,2</sub> <i>y</i><sub><i>N</i>,2</sub>
</pre>

<p>
where <i>N</i> (<i>N</i> &le; 100) is the number of slopes, <i>g</i> is gravity acceleration, and (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) is the initial
position of the ball. Each of the following <i>N</i> lines represents a slope, which is a line segment
between (<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>,1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub><i>i</i>,1</sub> ) and (<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>,2</sub>, <i>y</i><sub><i>i</i>,2</sub>).
</p>
<p>
You may assume that:
</p>
<ul>
   <li> all coordinates are more than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to 10,000;</li>
   <li> <i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>,1</sub> &ne; <i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>,2</sub> and <i>y</i><sub><i>i</i>,1</sub> &ne; <i>y</i><sub><i>i</i>,2</sub> for all 1 &le; <i>i</i> &le; <i>N</i>;</li>
   <li> no two line segments cross each other;</li>
<li> extending or shrinking a slope by the length of 0.0001 does not change the ball’s trail, that
  is, do not change the set of slopes where the ball passes;</li>
<li> the ball never collides to a slope at the angle of 90 &plusmn; 0.0001 degrees from the slope; and</li>
<li> the initial position of the ball never lies on any slope.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing a single zero. This is not a part of the
data sets, and you must not process it.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each data set, output the <i>x</i>-coordinate of the final crossing point of the ball’s trail and the
<i>x</i>-axis. Your program may print any number of digits after the decimal point, but the output
must not contain an error greater than 10<sup>-4</sup> (= 0.0001).
