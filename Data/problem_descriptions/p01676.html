<h2>J - Tree Reconstruction</h2>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
You have a directed graph.
Some non-negative value is assigned on each edge of the graph.
You know that the value of the graph satisfies the <em>flow conservation law</em>
That is, for every node <var>v</var>, the sum of values on edges incoming to <var>v</var> equals to
the sum of values of edges outgoing from <var>v</var>.
For example, the following directed graph satisfies the flow conservation law.

<p>
Suppose that you choose a subset of edges in the graph, denoted by <var>E'</var>,
and then you erase all the values on edges other than <var>E'</var>.
Now you want to recover the erased values by seeing only remaining information.
Due to the flow conservation law, it may be possible to recover all the erased values.
Your task is to calculate the smallest possible size for such <var>E'</var>.
</p>

<p>
For example, the smallest subset <var>E'</var> for the above graph will be green edges in the following figure.
By the flow conservation law, we can recover values on gray edges.

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
The input consists of multiple test cases.
The format of each test case is as follows.
</p>

<pre>
<var>N</var> <var>M</var>
<var>s_1</var> <var>t_1</var>
...
<var>s_M</var> <var>t_M</var>
</pre>

<p>
The first line contains two integers <var>N</var> (<var>1 \leq N \leq 500</var>) and <var>M</var> (<var>0 \leq M \leq 3,000</var>) that indicate the number of nodes and edges, respectively.
Each of the following <var>M</var> lines consists of two integers <var>s_i</var> and <var>t_i</var> (<var>1 \leq s_i, t_i \leq N</var>). This means that there is an edge from <var>s_i</var> to <var>t_i</var> in the graph.
</p>

<p>
You may assume that the given graph is simple:
</p>

<ul>
<li>There are no self-loops: <var>s_i \neq t_i</var>.</li>
<li>There are no multi-edges: for all <var>i < j</var>, <var>\{s_i, t_i\} \neq \{s_j, t_j\}</var>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, it is guaranteed that each component of the given graph is strongly connected.
That is, for every pair of nodes <var>v</var> and <var>u</var>, if there exist a path from <var>v</var> to <var>u</var>, then there exists a path from <var>u</var> to <var>v</var>.
</p>

<p>
Note that you are NOT given information of values on edges because it does not effect the answer.
</p>
