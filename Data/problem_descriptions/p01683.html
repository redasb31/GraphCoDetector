<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>You have just arrived in a small country. Unfortunately a huge hurricane swept across the country a few days ago.
</p>
<p>The country is made up of $n$ islands, numbered $1$ through $n$. Many bridges connected the islands, but all the bridges were washed away by a flood. People in the islands need new bridges to travel among the islands again.
</p>
<p>The problem is cost. The country is not very wealthy. The government has to keep spending down. They asked you, a great programmer, to calculate the minimum cost to rebuild bridges. Write a program to calculate it!
</p>
<p>Each bridge connects two islands bidirectionally. Each island $i$ has two parameters $d_i$ and $p_i$. An island $i$ can have at most $d_i$ bridges connected. The cost to build a bridge between an island $i$ and another island $j$ is calculated by $|p_i - p_j|$. Note that it may be impossible to rebuild new bridges within given limitations although people need to travel between any pair of islands over (a sequence of) bridges. 
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The input is a sequence of datasets.
The number of datasets is less than or equal to $60$.
Each dataset is formatted as follows.
</p>
<blockquote>$n$<br>$p_1$ $d_1$<br>$p_2$ $d_2$<br>:<br>:<br>$p_n$ $d_n$</blockquote>

<p>Everything in the input is an integer.
$n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 4{,}000$) on the first line indicates the number of islands.
Then $n$ lines follow, which contain the parameters of the islands.
$p_i$ ($1 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$) and $d_i$ ($1 \leq d_i \leq n$) denote the parameters of the island $i$.
</p>
<p>The end of the input is indicated by a line with a single zero.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each dataset, output the minimum cost in a line if it is possible to rebuild bridges within given limitations in the dataset. Otherwise, output $-1$ in a line.
</p>
