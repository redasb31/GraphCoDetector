<H1>Beautiful Currency</H1>

<p>
KM country has <var>N</var> kinds of coins and each coin has its value <var>a_i</var>.
</p>

<p>
The king of the  country, Kita_masa, thought that the current currency  system is poor,
and he decided to make it <i>beautiful</i> by changing the values of some (possibly no) coins.
</p>

<p>
A currency  system is called beautiful
if each coin has an integer value and the (<var>i</var>+1)-th smallest value is divisible by the <var>i</var>-th smallest value for all <var>i</var> (<var>1 \leq i \leq N-1</var>).
</p>

<p>
For example, the set <var>{1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500}</var>  is considered as a beautiful system,
while the set <var>{1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100}</var>  is NOT,
because <var>25</var> is not divisible by <var>10</var>.
</p>

<p>
Since changing the currency  system may confuse citizens,
the king, Kita_masa, wants to minimize the maximum value of the confusion ratios.
Here,  the confusion ratio for the change in the <var>i</var>-th coin is defined as <var>|a_i - b_i| / a_i</var>,
where <var>a_i</var> and <var>b_i</var> is the value of <var>i</var>-th coin before and after the structure changes, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Note that Kita_masa can change the value of each existing coin,
but he cannot introduce new coins nor eliminate existing coins.
After the modification, the values of two or more coins may coincide. 
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
Each dataset contains two lines.
The first line contains a single integer, <var>N</var>,
and the second line contains <var>N</var> integers, <var>{a_i}</var>.
</p>

<p>
You may assume the following constraints:
</p>

<p>
<var>1 \leq N \leq 20</var>
</p>

<p>
<var>1 \leq a_1 \lt a_2 \lt...  \lt a_N \lt 10^5</var>
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
Output one number  that represents the minimum of the maximum value of the confusion ratios.
The value may be printed with an arbitrary number of decimal digits,
but may not contain an absolute error greater than or equal to <var>10^{-8}</var>.
