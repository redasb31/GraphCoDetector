<h2>Problem K
  Counting Cycles
</h2>

<p>
  Given an undirected graph, count the number of simple cycles in the graph. Here, a simple cycle is a connected subgraph all of whose vertices have degree exactly two.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
  The input consists of a single test case of the following format.
</p>

<pre>
$n$ $m$
$u_1$ $v_1$
...
$u_m$ $v_m$
</pre>

<p>
  A test case represents an undirected graph $G$.
</p>

<p>
  The first line shows the number of vertices $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 100 000$) and the number of edges $m$ ($n - 1 \leq m \leq n + 15$). The vertices of the graph are numbered from $1$ to $n$.
</p>

<p>
The edges of the graph are specified in the following $m$ lines. Two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ in the
$i$-th line of these m lines mean that there is an edge between vertices $u_i$ and $v_i$. Here, you can assume that $u_i < v_i$ and thus there are no self loops.
															   </p>

<p>
  For all pairs of $i$ and $j$ ($i \ne j$), either $u_i \ne u_j$ or $v_i \ne v_j$ holds. In other words, there are no parallel edges.
</p>

<p>
  You can assume that $G$ is connected.
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  The output should be a line containing a single number that is the number of simple cycles in the graph.
