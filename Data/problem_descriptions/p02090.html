<h2>C: Shuttle Run</h2>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>
University H has a unique physical fitness test program, aiming to grow the mindset of students.
Among the items in the program, shuttle run is well-known as especially eccentric one. Surprisingly, there are yokans (sweet beans jellies) on a route of the shuttle run. Greedy Homura-chan would like to challenge to eat all the yokans. And lazy Homura-chan wants to make the distance she would run as short as possible. For her, you decided to write a program to compute the minimum distance she would run required to eat all the yokans.
</p>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>At the beginning of a shuttle run, Homura-chan is at <var>0 </var> in a positive direction on a number line. During the shuttle run, Homura-chan repeats the following moves:</p>

<ul>
<li> Move in a positive direction until reaching <var>M</var>.</li>
<li> When reaching <var>M</var>, change the direction to negative.</li>
<li> Move in a negative direction until reaching <var>0 </var>.</li>
<li> When reaching <var>0 </var>, change the direction to positive.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the moves, Homura-chan also eats yokans on the number line. There are <var>N</var> yokans on the number line. Initially, the <var>i</var>-th yokan, whose length is <var>R_i - L_i</var>, is at an interval <var>[L_i, R_i]</var> on the number line. When Homura-chan reaches <var>L_i</var> in a positive direction (or <var>R_i</var> in a negative direction), she can start eating the <var>i</var>-th yokan from <var>L_i</var> to <var>R_i</var> (or from <var>R_i</var> to <var>L_i</var>), and then the <var>i</var>-th yokan  disappears. Unfortunately, Homura-chan has only one mouth. So she cannot eat two yokans at the same moment, including even when she starts eating and finishes eating (See the example below). Also, note that she cannot stop eating in the middle of yokan and has to continue eating until she reaches the other end of the yokan she starts eating; it's her belief.</p>

<p>Calculate the minimum distance Homura-chan runs to finish eating all the yokans. The shuttle run never ends until Homura-chan eats all the yokans.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<pre>
<var>N</var> <var>M</var>
<var>L_1</var> <var>R_1</var>
<var>:</var>
<var>L_N</var> <var>R_N</var>
</pre>

<p>The first line contains two integers <var>N</var> and <var>M</var>. The following <var>N</var> lines represent the information of yokan, where the <var>i</var>-th of them contains two integers <var>L_i</var> and <var>R_i</var> corresponding to the interval <var>[L_i, R_i]</var> the <var>i</var>-th yokan is.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li><var>1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5</var></li>
<li><var>3 \leq M \leq 10^9</var></li>
<li><var>0 &lt; L_i &lt; R_i &lt; M</var></li>
<li> Inputs consist only of integers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output the minimum distance Homura-chan runs to eat all the given yokan in a line.</p>

<h3>Sample Input 1</h3>
<pre>
1 3
1 2
</pre>

<h3>Output for Sample Input 1</h3>
<pre>2</pre>

<h3>Sample Input 2</h3>
<pre>
2 5
1 2
2 4
</pre>

<h3>Output for Sample Input 2</h3>
<pre>8</pre>

<p>Note that when Homura-chan is at the coordinate <var>2</var>, she cannot eat the first and second yokan at the same time.</p>
