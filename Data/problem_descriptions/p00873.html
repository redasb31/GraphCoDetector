<p>
Given several points on a plane, letâ€™s try to solve a puzzle connecting them with a zigzag line.
The puzzle is to find the zigzag line that passes through all the given points with the minimum
number of turns. Moreover, when there are several zigzag lines with the minimum number of
turns, the shortest one among them should be found.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider nine points given in Figure 1.

</center>

<p>
A zigzag line is composed of several straight line segments. Here, the rule requests that each
line segment should pass through two or more given points.
</p>
<p>
A zigzag line may turn at some of the given points or anywhere else. There may be some given
points passed more than once.

<p>Figure 2: Zigzag lines with three turning points.</p>
</center>

<p>
Two zigzag lines with three turning points are depicted in Figure 2 (a) and (b) for the same
set of given points shown in Figure 1. The length of the zigzag line in Figure 2 (a) is shorter than that in Figure 2 (b). In fact, the length of the zigzag line in Figure 2 (a) is the shortest
so that it is the solution for the nine points given in Figure 1.
</p>
<p>
Another zigzag line with four turning points is depicted in Figure 3. Its length is shorter than
those in Figure 2, however, the number of turning points is greater than those in Figure 2,
and thus, it is not the solution.

<p>
There are two zigzag lines that passes another set of given points depicted in Figure 4 (a) and
(b).
</p>
<p>
Both have the same number of turning points, and the line in (a) is longer than that in (b).
However, the solution is (a), because one of the segments of the zigzag line in (b) passes only
one given point, violating the rule.

Your job is to write a program that solves this puzzle.

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple datasets, followed by a line containing one zero. Each dataset
has the following format.
</p>
<pre>
<i>n</i>
<i>x</i><sub>1</sub> <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>
   .
   .
   .
<i>x</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> <i>y</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>
</pre>

<p>
Every input item in a dataset is a non-negative integer. Items in a line are separated by a single
space.
</p>
<p>
<i>n</i> is the number of the given points. <i>x</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> and <i>y</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> (<i>k</i> = 1, . . . , <i>n</i>) indicate the position of the <i>k</i>-th
point. The order of the points is meaningless. You can assume that 2 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 10, 0 &le; <i>x</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> &le; 10,
and 0 &le; <i>y</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> &le; 10.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each dataset, the minimum number of turning points and the length of the shortest zigzag
line with that number of turning points should be printed, separated by a space in a line. The
length should be in a decimal fraction with an error less than 0.0001 (= 1.0 &times; 10<sup>-4</sup> ).
</p>
<p>
You may assume that the minimum number of turning points is at most four, that is, the number
of line segments is at most five.
</p>
<p>
The example solutions for the first four datasets in the sample input are depicted in Figure 5
and 6.
