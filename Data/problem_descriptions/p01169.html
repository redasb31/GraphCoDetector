<p>
HCII, the health committee for interstellar intelligence, aims to take care of the health of every
interstellar intelligence.
</p>
<p>
Staff of HCII uses a special equipment for health checks of patients. This equipment looks like a
polygon-shaped room with plenty of instruments. The staff puts a patient into the equipment,
then the equipment rotates clockwise to diagnose the patient from various angles. It fits many
species without considering the variety of shapes, but not suitable for big patients. Furthermore,
even if it fits the patient, it can hit the patient during rotation.

<p>
The interior shape of the equipment is a polygon with <i>M</i> vertices, and the shape of patients
is a <i>convex</i> polygon with <i>N</i> vertices. Your job is to calculate how much you can rotate the
equipment clockwise without touching the patient, and output the angle in degrees.
</p>


<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple data sets, followed by a line containing “0 0”. Each data set is
given as follows:
</p>

<pre>
<i>M N</i>
<i>px</i><sub>1</sub> <i>py</i><sub>1</sub> <i>px</i><sub>2</sub> <i>py</i><sub>2</sub> ... <i>px<sub>M</sub> py<sub>M</sub></i>
<i>qx</i><sub>1</sub> <i>qy</i><sub>1</sub> <i>qx</i><sub>2</sub> <i>qy</i><sub>2</sub> ... <i>qx<sub>N</sub> qy<sub>N</sub></i>
<i>cx cy</i>
</pre>

<p>
The first line contains two integers <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> (3 &le; <i>M, N</i> &le; 10). The second line contains 2<i>M</i>
integers, where (<i>px<sub>j</sub></i> , <i>py<sub>j</sub></i> ) are the coordinates of the <i>j</i>-th vertex of the equipment. The third
line contains 2<i>N</i> integers, where (<i>qx<sub>j</sub></i> , <i>qy<sub>j</sub></i> ) are the coordinates of the <i>j</i>-th vertex of the patient.
The fourth line contains two integers <i>cx</i> and <i>cy</i>, which indicate the coordinates of the center of
rotation.
</p>
<p>
All the coordinates are between -1000 and 1000, inclusive. The vertices of each polygon are
given in counterclockwise order.
</p>
<p>
At the initial state, the patient is inside the equipment, and they don’t intersect each other.
You may assume that the equipment doesn’t approach patients closer than 10<sup>-6</sup> without hitting
patients, and that the equipment gets the patient to stick out by the length greater than 10<sup>-6</sup>
whenever the equipment keeps its rotation after hitting the patient.

</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each data set, print the angle in degrees in a line. Each angle should be given as a decimal
with an arbitrary number of fractional digits, and with an absolute error of at most 10<sup>-7</sup> .
</p>
<p>
If the equipment never hit the patient during the rotation, print 360 as the angle.
</p>
