<p>
You are one of ICPC participants and in charge of developing a library for multiprecision numbers
and radix conversion. You have just finished writing the code, so next you have to test if it
works correctly. You decided to write a simple, well-known factorial function for this purpose:

<p>
Your task is to write a program that shows the number of trailing zeros when you compute <i>M</i>!
in base <i>N</i>, given <i>N</i> and <i>M</i>.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input contains multiple data sets. Each data set is described by one line in the format
below:
</p>
<pre>
      <i>N M</i>
</pre>
<p>
where <i>N</i> is a decimal number between 8 and 36 inclusive, and <i>M</i> is given in the string repre-
sentation in base <i>N</i>. Exactly one white space character appears between them.
</p>
<p>
The string representation of <i>M</i> contains up to 12 characters in base <i>N</i>. In case <i>N</i> is greater
than 10, capital letters A, B, C, ... may appear in the string representation, and they represent
10, 11, 12, ..., respectively.
</p>
<p>
The input is terminated by a line containing two zeros. You should not process this line.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each data set, output a line containing a decimal integer, which is equal to the number of
trailing zeros in the string representation of <i>M</i>! in base <i>N</i>.
