<h2>F： 最短距離を伸ばすえびちゃん (Ebi-chan Lengthens Shortest Paths)</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>
Ebi-chan loves directed graphs.
One day, a directed graph with <var>N</var> vertices and <var>M</var> edges dropped from somewhere in front of Ebi-chan!
The vertices and the edges of the graph is labeled with a number from <var>1</var> to <var>N</var> and from <var>1</var> to <var>M</var>, respectively.
Moreover, the <var>i</var>th edge directs from a vertex <var>u_i</var> to a vertex <var>v_i</var> with distance <var>d_i</var>.
</p>

<p>
Ebi-chan thought that, for a pair of vertices <var>s</var> and <var>t</var>, she tries to lengthen the distance of shortest paths from <var>s</var> to <var>t</var>.
Although Ebi-chan should lengthen all edges slightly to easily achieve hers goal, she can not enjoy the directed graph with such way!
So, she decided the following rules of operations that can be done by her.
</p>

<ul>
<li> She can lengthen each edges independently.</li>
<li> When she lengthens an edge, she must select the additional distance from positive integers.</li>
<li> The <var>i</var>th edge takes a cost <var>c_i</var> per additional distance 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>How is the minimum total cost of operations needed to achieve Ebi-chan’s goal?</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>An input is given in the following format.</p>

<pre>
<var>N</var> <var>M</var> <var>s</var> <var>t</var>
<var>u_1</var> <var>v_1</var> <var>d_1</var> <var>c_1</var>
$\vdots$
<var>u_M</var> <var>v_M</var> <var>d_M</var> <var>c_M</var>
</pre>

<p>In line <var>1</var>, four integers <var>N</var>, <var>M</var>, <var>s</var>, and <var>t</var> are given in separating by en spaces. <var>N</var> and <var>M</var> is the number of vertices and edges, respectively. Ebi-chan tries to lengthen shortest paths from the vertex <var>s</var> to the vertex <var>t</var>.</p>

<p>Line <var>1 + i</var>, where <var>1 \leq i \leq M</var>, has the information of the <var>i</var>th edge. <var>u_i</var> and <var>v_i</var> are the start and end vertices of the edge, respectively. <var>d_i</var> and <var>c_i</var> represents the original distance and cost of the edge, respectively. These integers are given in separating by en spaces.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<li> <var>2 \leq N \leq 200</var></li>
<li> <var>1 \leq M \leq 2,000</var></li>
<li> <var>1 \leq s, t \leq N, s \neq t</var></li>
<li> <var>1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq N, u_i \neq v_i</var> (<var>1 \leq i \leq M</var>) </li>
<li> For each <var>i, j</var> (<var>1 \leq i &lt; j \leq M</var>), <var>u_i \neq u_j</var> or <var>v_i \neq v_j</var> are satisfied.</li>
<li> <var>1 \leq d_i \leq 10</var> (<var>1 \leq i \leq M</var>)</li>
<li> <var>1 \leq c_i \leq 10</var> (<var>1 \leq i \leq M</var>)</li>
<li> It is guaranteed that there is at least one path from <var>s</var> to <var>t</var>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>Print the minimum cost, that is to lengthen the distance of shortest paths from <var>s</var> to <var>t</var> at least 1, in one line.</p>
