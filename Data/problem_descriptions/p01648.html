<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
You are given a connected undirected graph which has even numbers of nodes.
A connected graph is a graph in which all nodes are connected directly or indirectly by  edges.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to find a spanning tree whose median value of edges' costs is  minimum.
A spanning tree of a graph means that a tree which contains all nodes of the graph.
</p>


<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple  datasets.
</p>

<p>
The format of each dataset is as follows.
</p>

<pre>
<var>n</var> <var>m</var>
<var>s_1</var> <var>t_1</var> <var>c_1</var>
...
<var>s_m</var> <var>t_m</var> <var>c_m</var>
</pre>

<p>
The first line contains an even number <var>n</var> (<var>2 \leq n \leq 1,000</var>) and an integer <var>m</var> <var>(n-1 \leq m \leq 10,000)</var>.
<var>n</var> is the nubmer of nodes and <var>m</var> is the number of edges in the graph.
</p>

<p>
Then <var>m</var> lines follow, each of which contains <var>s_i</var> (<var>1 \leq s_i \leq n</var>), <var>t_i</var> (<var>1 \leq s_i \leq n, t_i \neq s_i</var>) and <var>c_i</var> (<var>1 \leq c_i \leq 1,000</var>).
This means there is an edge between the nodes <var>s_i</var> and <var>t_i</var>  and its cost is <var>c_i</var>.
There is no more than one edge which connects <var>s_i</var> and <var>t_i</var>.
</p>

<p>
The input terminates when <var>n=0</var> and <var>m=0</var>.
Your program must not output anything for this case.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
Print the median value in a line for each dataset.
