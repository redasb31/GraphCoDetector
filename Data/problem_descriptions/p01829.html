<h2>Change a Password</h2>

<p>
Password authentication is used in a lot of facilities. The office of JAG also uses password authentication. A password is required to enter their office. A password is a string of $N$ digits '0'-'9'. This password is changed on a regular basis. Taro, a staff of the security division of JAG, decided to use the following rules to generate a new password from an old one.
</p>

<ol>
<li> The new password consists of the same number $N$ of digits to the original one and each digit appears at most once in the new password. It can have a leading zero. (Note that an old password may contain same digits twice or more.)</li>
<li> The new password maximizes the difference from the old password within constraints described above. (Definition of the difference between two passwords is described below.)</li>
<li> If there are two or more candidates, the one which has the minimum value when it is read as an integer will be selected.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The difference between two passwords is defined by <i>min</i>($|a - b|,  10^N - |a - b|$), where $a$ and $b$ are the integers represented by the two passwords. For example, the difference between "11" and "42" is 31, and the difference between "987" and "012" is 25.
</p>

<p>
Taro would like to use a computer to calculate a new password correctly, but he is not good at programming. Therefore, he asked you to write a program. Your task is to write a program that generates a new password from an old password.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input consists of a single test case. The first line of the input contains a string $S$ which denotes the old password. You can assume that the length of $S$ is no less than 1 and no greater than 10. Note that old password $S$ may contain same digits twice or more, and may have leading zeros.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Print the new password in a line.
