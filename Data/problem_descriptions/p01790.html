<h2>Problem A
Balanced Paths</h2>

<p>
You are given an undirected tree with $n$ nodes. The nodes are numbered 1 through $n$. Each node is labeled with either '(' or ')'. Let $l[u \rightarrow v]$ denote the string obtained by concatenating the labels of the nodes on the simple path from $u$ to $v$. (Note that the simple path between two nodes is uniquely determined on a tree.) A <i>balanced</i> string is defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> The empty string is balanced.</li>
<li> For any balanced string $s$, the string "(" $s$ ")" is balanced.</li>
<li> For any balanced strings $s$ and $t$, the string $st$ (the concatenation of $s$ and $t$) is balanced.</li>
<li> Any other string is NOT balanced.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Calculate the number of the ordered pairs of the nodes ($u$, $v$) such that $l[u \rightarrow v]$ is balanced.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
The input consists of a single test case. The input starts with an integer $n (2 \leq n \leq 10^5)$, which is the number of nodes of the tree. The next line contains a string of length $n$, each character of which is either '(' or ')'. The $x$-th character of the string represents the label of the node $x$ of the tree. Each of the following $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ $(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq n)$, which represents that the node $a_i$ and the node $b_i$ are connected by an edge. The given graph is guaranteed to be a tree.
