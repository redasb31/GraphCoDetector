<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
We found a dictionary of the Ancient Civilization Mayo (ACM) during excavation of the ruins.
After analysis of the dictionary, we revealed they used a language that had not more than 26 letters.
So one of us mapped each letter to a different English alphabet and typed all the words in the dictionary into a computer.
</p>

<p>
How the words are ordered in the dictionary, especially whether they are ordered lexicographically, is an interesting topic to many people.
As a good programmer, you are requested to write a program to judge whether we can consider the words to be sorted in a lexicographical order.
</p>

<p>
Note:
In a lexicographical order, a word always precedes other words it is a prefix of.
For example, <code>ab</code> 
precedes <code>abc</code>, 
<code>abde</code>, and so on.
</p>


<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is formatted as follows:
</p>

<pre>
<var>n</var>
<var>string_1</var>
...
<var>string_n</var>
</pre>

<p>
Each dataset consists of <var>n+1</var> lines.
The first line of each dataset contains an integer that indicates <var>n</var> (<var>1 \leq n \leq 500</var>).
The <var>i</var>-th line of the following <var>n</var> lines contains <var>string_i</var>, which consists of up to 10 English lowercase letters.
</p>

<p>
The end of the input is <code>0</code>, and this should not be processed.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
Print either <code>yes</code> or 
<code>no</code> in a line for each dataset, in the order of the input.
If all words in the dataset can be considered to be ordered lexicographically, print <code>yes</code>.
Otherwise, print <code>no</code>.
