<p>
Brian Fulk is struggling with a really poor computer for a couple of days. Now he is trying to write a very simple program which receives a positive integer <i>x</i> and returns some of its multiples, say, <i>a</i><sub>1</sub><i>x</i>,...,<i>a</i><sub><i>N</i></sub><i>x</i>. However, even such a simple task is not easy on this computer since it has only three arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction and left shift.
</p>

<p>
Let us describe the situation in more details. Initially the computer stores only a given positive integer <i>x</i>. The program Brian is writing will produce <i>a</i><sub>1</sub><i>x</i>,..., <i>a</i><sub><i>N</i></sub><i>x</i>, where <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>,...,<i>a</i><sub><i>N</i></sub> are given multipliers, using only the following operations:
</p>

<ul>
<li> addition of two values,</li>
<li> subtraction of two values, and</li>
<li> bitwise left shift (left shift by n bits is equivalent to multiplication by 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The program should not generate any value greater than 42<i>x</i>; under this constraint he can assume that no overflow occurs. Also, since this computer cannot represent negative values, there should not be subtraction of a greater value from a smaller value.
</p>

<p>
Some of you may wonder where the number 42 comes from. There is a deep reason related to the answer to life, the universe and everything, but we don't have enough space and time to describe it.
<?p>

<p>
Your task is to write a program that finds the shortest sequence of operations to produce the multiples <i>a</i><sub>1</sub><i>x</i>,...,<i>a</i><sub><i>N</i></sub><i>x</i> and reports the length of the sequence. These numbers may be produced in any order.
</p>

<p>
Here we give an example sequence for the first sample input, in a C++/Java-like language:
</p>

<pre>
a = x << 1;  // 2x
b = x + a;   // 3x
c = a + b;   // 5x
d = c << 2;  // 20x
e = d - b;   // 18x
</pre>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The first line specifies <i>N</i>, the number of multipliers. The second line contains <i>N</i> integers <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>,..., <i>a</i><sub><i>N</i></sub>, each of which represents a multiplier of <i>x</i>.
</p>

<p>
You can assume that <i>N</i> &le; 41 and 2 &le; <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> &le; 42 (1 &le; <i>i</i> &le; <i>N</i>). Furthermore, <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>,...,<i>a<sub>N</sub></i> are all distinct.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
Output in a line the minimum number of operations you need to produce the values <i>a</i><sub>1</sub><i>x</i>,...,<i>a</i><sub><i>N</i></sub><i>x</i>.
