<p>
Three-valued logic is a logic system that has, in addition to "true" and 
"false", "unknown" as a valid value.  

In the following, logical values "false", "unknown" and "true" are 
represented by 0, 1 and 2 respectively. 
</p><p>
Let "-" be a unary operator (i.e. a symbol representing one argument function) 
and let both "*" and "+" be binary operators (i.e. symbols representing 
two argument functions). 
These operators represent negation (NOT), conjunction (AND) and 
disjunction (OR) respectively. 
These operators in three-valued logic can be defined in Table C-1.

Let P, Q and R be variables ranging over three-valued logic values. 
For a given formula, you are asked to answer the number of triples (P,Q,R) 
that satisfy the formula, that is, those which make the value of the 
given formula 2. 
A formula is one of the following form (X and Y represent formulas). 
</p>
<ul>
<li> Constants: 0, 1 or 2
<li> Variables: P, Q or R
<li> Negations: -X
<li> Conjunctions: (X*Y)
<li> Disjunctions: (X+Y)
</ul>
<p>
Note that conjunctions and disjunctions of two formulas are always 
parenthesized.

For example, when formula (P*Q) is given as an input, the value of 
this formula is 2 when and only when (P,Q,R) is (2,2,0), (2,2,1) or (2,2,2). 
Therefore, you should output 3. 
<!-- end en only -->
</p>


<h3>Input</h3>
<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
The input consists of one or more lines. Each line contains a formula. 
A formula is a string which consists of 0, 1, 2, P, Q, R, -, *, +, (, ). 
Other characters such as spaces are not contained. 
The grammar of formulas is given by the following BNF. 
</p>
<!-- end en only -->

<pre>
&lt;formula&gt; ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | P | Q | R |
              -&lt;formula&gt; | (&lt;formula&gt;*&lt;formula&gt;) | (&lt;formula&gt;+&lt;formula&gt;)
</pre>

<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
All the formulas obey this syntax and thus you do not have to care about 
grammatical errors.
Input lines never exceed 80 characters.  
</p><p>
Finally, a line which
contains only a "." (period) comes, indicating the end of the input.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->




<h3>Output</h3>
<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
You should answer the number (in decimal) of triples (P,Q,R) that make the 
value of the given formula 2.  One line containing the number should be 
output for each of the formulas, and no other characters should be output.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->
