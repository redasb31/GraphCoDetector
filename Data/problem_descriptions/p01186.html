<H1><font color="#000">Problem F:</font> TV Watching</H1>

<p>
You are addicted to watching TV, and you watch so many TV programs every day. You have been in
trouble recently: the airtimes of your favorite TV programs overlap.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, you have both a TV and a video recorder at your home. You can therefore watch a program
on air while another program (on a different channel) is recorded to a video at the same time. However,
it is not easy to decide which programs should be watched on air or recorded to a video. As you are a
talented computer programmer, you have decided to write a program to find the way of watching TV
programs which gives you the greatest possible satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
Your program (for a computer) will be given TV listing of a day along with your <i>score</i> for each TV
program. Each score represents how much you will be satisfied if you watch the corresponding TV
program on air or with a video. Your program should compute the maximum possible sum of the scores
of the TV programs that you can watch.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of several scenarios.
</p>
<p>
The first line of each scenario contains an integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 1000) that represents the number of
programs. Each of the following <i>N</i> lines contains program information in the format below:
</p
<pre>
      <i>T</i> <i>T</i><sub><i>b</i></sub> <i>T</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> <i>R</i><sub>2</sub>
</pre>
<p>
<i>T</i> is the title of the program and is composed by up to 32 alphabetical letters. <i>T</i><sub><i>b</i></sub> and <i>T</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> specify the
start time and the end time of broadcasting, respectively. <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> indicate the score when you watch
the program on air and when you have the program recorded, respectively.
</p>
<p>
All times given in the input have the form of “hh:mm” and range from 00:00 to 23:59. You may assume
that no program is broadcast across the twelve midnight.
</p>
<p>
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing only a single zero. This is not part of scenarios.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each scenario, output the maximum possible score in a line.
