<p>
Two contries A and B have decided to make a meeting to get acquainted with each other. <i>n</i> ambassadors
from A and B will attend the meeting in total.
</p>

<p>
A round table is prepared for in the meeting. The ambassadors are getting seated at the round table, but
they have agreed that more than k ambassadors from the same country does not sit down at the round
table in a row for deeper exchange.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to write a program that reports the number of possible arrangements when rotations are not
counted. Your program should report the number modulo <i>M</i> = 1000003.
</p>
<p>
Let us provide an example. Suppose <i>n</i> = 4 and <i>k</i> = 2. When rotations are counted as different arrangements, the following six arrangements are possible.
</p>
<pre>
       AABB
       ABBA
       BBAA
       BAAB
       ABAB
       BABA
</pre>
<p>
However, when rotations are regarded as same, the following two arrangements are possible.
</p>
<pre>
       AABB
       ABAB
</pre>

<p>
Therefore the program should report 2.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of two integers <i>n</i> (1 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 1000) and <i>k</i> (1 &le; k &le; 1000) in one line.
</p>
<p>
It does not always hold <i>k</i> &lt; <i>n</i>. This means the program should consider cases in which the ambassadors
from only one country attend the meeting.
</p>

<p>
The last dataset is followed by a line containing two zeros. This line is not a part of any dataset and should not be processed.
</p>


<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each dataset, print the number of possible arrangements modulo <i>M</i> = 1000003 in one line.
