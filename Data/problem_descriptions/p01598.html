<h2>Problem H: Testing Sorting Networks</h2>

<p>A <var>N</var> sorting network is a circuit that accepts <var>N</var>
numbers as its input, outputs them sorted. Mr. Smith is an engineer of a company
that sells various sizes of the circuit.</p>

<p>One day, the company got an order of <var>N</var> sorting networks.
Unfortunately, they didn't have the circuit for <var>N</var> numbers at the
time. The clerk once declined the order for being out of stock, but the client
was so urgent that he offered much money if he could get the circuit in a week.
The deal escalated to a manager, and she asked Mr. Smith for a solution to
produce the <var>N</var> sorting networks by the deadline.</p>

<p>He came up with an idea to combine several <var>N/2</var> sorting
networks, because he noticed that they have many stocks of the circuits for <var>N/2</var>
numbers. He designed a new circuit using the <var>N/2</var> sorting networks,
but he was not sure if it would really work as an <var>N</var> sorting network.
So, he asked a colleague, you, to check if it was actually an <var>N</var>
sorting network.</p>

<p>The circuit he designed consists of multiple stages. Each stage of the
circuit consists of two <var>N/2</var> sorting networks, which makes each stage
accept a sequence of <var>N</var> numbers as inputs and output a sequence of <var>N</var>
numbers. From the 1st to the <var>N/2</var>-th input numbers of a stage goes to
one of those <var>N/2</var> sorting networks, and from the <var>(N/2+1)</var>-th
to the <var>N</var>-th input numbers goes to the other. Similarly, the first
half of the output numbers of a stage is the output of the former sorting
network and the second half is the output of the latter, both of which are
sorted in ascending order. Each output of a stage is connected to exactly one
input of the next stage, and no two inputs are connected to the same output
line. The input of the last stage is the input of the whole circuit and the
output of the first stage is the output of the whole circuit.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a line containing a positive even integer <var>N</var>
(4 <= <var>N</var> <= 100) and a positive integer <var>D</var> (1 <= <var>D</var>
<= 10). <var>N</var> indicates the number of the input and output of the circuit
and <var>D</var> indicates the number of the stages of the circuit. The <var>i</var>-th
line of the following <var>D-1</var> lines contains <var>N</var> integers <var>w<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub></var>,
<var>w<sub>i<sub>2</sub></sub></var>,..., <var>w<sub>i<sub>N</sub></sub></var>
(1 <= <var>w<sub>i<sub>j</sub></sub></var> <= <var>N</var> ), which describes
the wiring between the <var>i</var>-th and <var>(i+1)</var>-th stages. <var>w<sub>i<sub>j</sub></sub></var>
indicates the <var>j</var>-th input of the <var>i</var>-th stage and the <var>w<sub>i<sub>j</sub></sub></var>-th
output of the <var>(i+1)</var>-th stage are wired. You can assume <var>w<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub></var>,
<var>w<sub>i<sub>2</sub></sub></var>,..., <var>w<sub>i<sub>N</sub></sub></var>
are unique for each <var>i</var>.</p>


<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a line containing "Yes" if the circuit works as an <var>N</var>
sorting network. Print "No" otherwise.</p>
