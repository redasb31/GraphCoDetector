<H1><font color="#000">Problem B:</font> Prime Gap</H1>

<p>
The sequence of <i>n</i> - 1 consecutive composite numbers (positive integers that are not prime and
not equal to 1) lying between two successive prime numbers <i>p</i> and <i>p</i> + <i>n</i> is called a <i>prime</i> gap of length <i>n</i>. For example, (24, 25, 26, 27, 28) between 23 and 29 is a prime gap of length 6.
</p>
<p>
Your mission is to write a program to calculate, for a given positive integer <i>k</i>, the length of the prime gap that contains <i>k</i>. For convenience, the length is considered 0 in case no prime gap
contains <i>k</i>.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input is a sequence of lines each of which contains a single positive integer. Each positive
integer is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the 100000th prime number, which is 1299709.
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing a single zero.

</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
The output should be composed of lines each of which contains a single non-negative integer. It
is the length of the prime gap that contains the corresponding positive integer in the input if it
is a composite number, or 0 otherwise. No other characters should occur in the output.
