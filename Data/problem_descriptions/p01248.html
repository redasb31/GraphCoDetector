<H1><font color="#000">Problem I:</font> Text Justification</H1>

<p>
You are hired by the ∀I¶אΞ℘, an extraterrestrial intelligence, as a programmer of their typesetting system. Your
task today is to design an algorithm for <i>text justification</i>.
</p>
<p>
Text justification is to equalize the line widths as much as possible by inserting line breaks at appropriate posi-
tions, given a word sequence called a <i>paragraph</i> and the width of the paper. Since you have not developed an
automatic hyphenation algorithm yet, you cannot break a line in the middle of a word. And since their language
does not put spaces between words, you do not need to consider about spacing.
</p>
<p>
To measure how well the text is justified in one configuration (i.e., a set of lines generated by inserting line breaks
to a paragraph), you have defined its <i>cost</i> as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> The total cost of a paragraph is the sum of the cost of each line.</li>
    <li> The cost for the last line is defined as max(0, <i>s</i> - <i>w</i>).</li>
    <li> The cost for other lines are given by |<i>s</i> - <i>w</i>|.</li>
</ul>
<p>
where <i>s</i> is the sum of the widths of the words in the line, and <i>w</i> is the width of the paper.
</p>
<p>
Please design the algorithm which takes a paragraph and calculates the configuration of the minimum cost.
</p>

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input consists of multiple test cases.
</p>
<p>
The first line of each test case contains two positive integers <i>n</i> and <i>w</i> (0 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 1000 and 0 &le; <i>w</i> &le; 1,000,000). <i>n</i>
is the length of paragraph and <i>w</i> is the width of the used paper. Each of the following n lines contains one positive
integer <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> which indicates the width of the <i>i</i>-th word in the paragraph. Here it is guaranteed that 0 &le; <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> &le; <i>w</i>.
</p>
<p>
The input terminates with the line containing two zeros. This is not a part of any test case and should not be
processed.

</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each test case, print the case number and the minimum cost for the paragraph.
