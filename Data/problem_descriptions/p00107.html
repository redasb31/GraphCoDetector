<p>
Jerry is a little mouse. He is trying to survive from the cat Tom. Jerry is carrying a parallelepiped-like piece of cheese of size <i>A</i> &times; <i>B</i> &times; <i>C</i>. It is necessary to trail this cheese to the Jerry's house. There are several entrances in the Jerry's house. Each entrance is a rounded hole having its own radius <i>R</i>. Could you help Jerry to find suitable holes to be survive?

</p>

<p>
Your task is to create a program which estimates whether Jerry can trail the cheese via each hole.
The program should print "<span>OK</span>" if Jerry can trail the cheese via the corresponding hole (without touching it). Otherwise the program should print "<span>NA</span>".
</p>
<p>
You may assume that the number of holes is less than 10000.

<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
The input is a sequence of datasets. The end of input is indicated by a line containing three zeros. Each dataset is formatted as follows:
</p>
<pre>
<i>A B C</i>
<i>n</i>
<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>
<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>

 .
 .
<i>R</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>
</pre>

<p>
<i>n</i> indicates the number of holes (entrances) and <i>R<sub>i</sub></i> indicates the radius of <i>i</i>-th hole.
</p>


<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
For each datasets, the output should have <i>n</i> lines. Each line points the result of estimation of the corresponding hole.
